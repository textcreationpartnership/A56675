            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>TO permit theſe Papers to go abroad under your Name, which are writ in defence of that moſt holy Religion, of which your <hi>Grace</hi> is the prime Miniſter in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. They contain an explication but of a very few words; yet in them lies the whole Evidence for the Chriſtian Cauſe. I hope I have done ſomething to clear their ſence,
<pb facs="tcp:204181:7"/>and to illuſtrate divers other paſſages in the holy Books. I have, at leaſt, done my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and opened the way to the plaineſt and moſt Apoſtolical method of aſſerting the truth of our Religion. They that come after may ſupply the defects, and rectifie the miſtakes, which they find in this account that I have given of the Witneſſes to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. Who ſpeak ſo fully and with ſuch Authority, that it is a matter of juſt wonder there ſhould be any Infidels in Chriſtian Countries.</p>
                  <p>We can find no other cauſe of it, but that in ſtead of conſidering upon what grounds our Faith relies, they ſcornfully preſume that it hath none. If they would but lay aſide their lightneſs, and become ſerious, and if they would be ſo humble as to think it is poſſible they may learn of one of the deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Miniſters of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt; I doubt not they would, with a little ſtudy, ſoon ſee him to be ſo great a Lord, that they ought to have a due reſpect to the meaneſt of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb facs="tcp:204181:7"/>for his ſake. Nay, they would not envy to them ſuch high Dignities, as your <hi>Grace</hi> worthily holds in the Church of Chriſt. For the Lord himſelf is honoured, in the honour that is done to his Miniſters. And thereby they are made capable to do him ſtill better ſervice; and with the more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to promote the honour of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Of which how much your Grace hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, by your prudent care and vigilance for its preſervation, and by the countenance and encouragement you give to thoſe that labour in its ſervice; poſterity perhaps may be better judges than this preſent Age. Though that cannot be ſo ungrateful as not to acknowledge your great Munificence and Bounty; of which there are ſuch publick and laſting Monuments, as declare you to be <hi>Primate of all England,</hi> not only in the dignity of your Office, but, which is more, in the generoſity of your Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:204181:8"/>Long may our <hi>Soveraign</hi> enjoy ſuch a wiſe Counſellor, the <hi>Church</hi> ſuch a Prudent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, <hi>Learning</hi> ſuch a liberal Patron and Benefactor, and, when through mere Age you muſt reſign and exchange it for a higher and better place, your <hi>See</hi> ſuch a Succeſſor.</p>
                  <p>As for my ſelf, if your <hi>Grace</hi> will be pleaſed to pardon this Addreſs, and reckon me in the number of thoſe, that reverence your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues as well as your Greatneſs, I ſhall not doubt but my Deſign in this Work will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your <hi>Graces</hi> approbation; and that your known Candor will paſs a favourable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the weak endeavours of</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>An Introduction to the Enſuing Diſcourſe, ſhewing the Scope of it.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT is not my deſign in this Diſcourſe, to explain and eſtabliſh the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity; which ſeveral great Writers have inferred, with much appearance of reaſon, from the remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able difference there is between thoſe words whereby S. <hi>John</hi> expreſſes the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the firſt three witneſſes, and thoſe whereby he expreſſes the Unity of the laſt: But to ſettle the Faith and Hope of Chriſtian Souls, in the Lord <hi>Jeſus;</hi> which is the true ſcope of the Apoſtle in this part of his Epiſtle, though in no Treatiſe, that I have met withal, it hath from hence been diſtinctly and fully repreſented.</p>
                     <p>That this is the drift of the Apoſtles Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and ought to be the intention of mine; will be very apparent, if we go
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:204181:14"/>but back ſo far as the <hi>fourth</hi> Verſe of this Chapter, and from thence take our riſe for that Argument, which I purpoſe to purſue. To know that we are <hi>born of God,</hi> and ſo ſhall be his Heirs, is a thing in which, above all others, we are moſt highly concern'd. That we may have therefore a certain character of one divinely deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, S. <hi>John</hi> lays down this General mark of him whereby he may be known, that <hi>Whatſoever is born of God, overcometh the World.</hi> By this a Chriſtian is to be tried, and hereby he diſcovers himſelf what he is, whether the child of God in name only or in deed and in truth. If when he meets with any thing in this world that would ſeduce or affright him from his duty, he not only defies it and ſets himſelf againſt it, but makes it yield to his reſolution of ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt obedience to God's Commandments (which every man, he ſays in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe, that loves God, will certainly keep and not think them <hi>grievous</hi> neither) it is a plain demonſtration that he is dear to God, and hath his very Spirit in him.</p>
                     <p>Now next to this there is nothing more neceſſary and deſirable to be known, than how we may obtain this great and match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs victory over every thing in the world
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:204181:14"/>that oppoſes our Chriſtian reſolution; and ſo undoubtedly approve our ſelves <hi>heroical perſons,</hi> as they were anciently called, that are born from above. And here alſo the Apoſtle lends us his aſſiſtance; telling us in the latter end of that <hi>fourth</hi> Verſe, that we muſt atchieve it by Faith. <hi>And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our Faith.</hi> So couragious, ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſo ſucceſsful is an hearty lively Faith, that you ſee he calls it by the name of <hi>victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> it ſelf. If we believe ſtedfaſtly, we ſhall tread the world under our feet, and eaſily deſpiſe all its temptations; as thoſe valiant Worthies did, whoſe example ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtle ſets before us, in the Eleventh Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> A portion of Scripture which he that means to be a conqueror, ſhould think he can never read too oft.</p>
                     <p>But there is a farther enquiry remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which every body will be apt to make; and that is, what this <hi>Faith</hi> may be, which is ſo victorious and triumphant. And therefore the Apoſtle takes care to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us in this matter alſo; when he tells us, Verſe 5. it is nothing elſe but <hi>to believe that Jeſus is the Son of God.</hi> To be hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded, he means, that that great
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:204181:15"/>perſon, who was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and was known by the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and overcame the world ſo gloriouſly, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſent from God unto us, and owned by him as <hi>the expreſs image of his perſon;</hi> ſo that we may as infallibly depend upon the truth of what he hath ſaid, either of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or concerning us, as we can upon any thing of Senſe or Reaſon; by which we think our ſelves bound to guide and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our reſolutions and actions in this life.</p>
                     <p>But ſtill after all this, there is one thing more that we cannot but deſire to be very ſure of; without which all the reſt will ſtand us in no ſtead, but we ſhall flag and deſpair of ſucceſs, <hi>viz. That Jeſus is indeed the Son of God.</hi> This if it be not well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſubſtantial arguments, we can have no ſolid faith, and ſo no victory; and ſo no ſon-ſhip, no hope in another world. The Apoſtle therefore, that he may ſerve us in bringing ſome evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of this ſo important a truth, tells us in the next words (Verſe 6.) that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did not only ſay he was God's Son, and confidently affirm himſelf to be the Divine perſon ſo long look'd for, to come into the world; but that he came with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:204181:15"/>very ſufficient and unreproveable witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>WATER,</hi> the <hi>BLOUD,</hi> and the <hi>SPIRIT:</hi> which made this truth good to all thoſe, who conſidered their teſtimony. If the firſt of theſe <hi>[WATER]</hi> ſhould not be thought great enough to merit belief; yet the <hi>[BLOUD]</hi> joyned with it adds great force to its perſwaſion. Or if both theſe ſeem too weak, yet this laſt, the <hi>SPIRIT,</hi> the Apoſtle doubts not is ſo ſtrong to conquer mens minds, and make them believe in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that he ſays, <hi>The Spirit is truth.</hi> That is, ſuch an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed proof that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was what he pretended to be, <hi>the Son of God;</hi> that no man can be deceived who relies upon it, and no man can refuſe, if he give heed to it, to rely and depend upon ſuch a witneſs.</p>
                     <p>Now this was a thing notorious in thoſe days, and needed no proof at all, the whole Country of <hi>Judaea</hi> could witneſs it, that <hi>he came by</hi> (or rather <hi>with</hi>) <hi>Water, Bloud and the Spirit.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle doth not go about to make this good, that there were ſuch <hi>Witneſſes</hi> (it being a matter confeſſed) but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats it over again, as the ſtrongeſt proof of his Divine Authority: adding more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204181:16"/>there-withal, that there were three other Witneſſes, who by their concurrent teſtimony would unanimouſly juſtifie this Truth. <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, in the words I have choſen to explain, <hi>There are three that bear record (or witneſs) in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt: and theſe three are one. And there are three that bear witneſs in Earth, the Spirit, and the Water, and the Bloud: and theſe three agree in one.</hi> As if he had ſaid, You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably doubt of that which we preach concerning <hi>Jeſus,</hi> if you go but to thoſe three witneſſes, to which I have ſent you, the <hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>Bloud</hi> and the <hi>Spirit;</hi> for they all affirm with one mouth, that he was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> And as they teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this to you upon the Earth; ſo there are three other Witneſſes alſo who declare it to you from Heaven: to whom I firſt direct you; and then to thoſe three that here on Earth, as I have told you, bear their record to him.</p>
                     <p>There are not a few Copies of the New Teſtament, it muſt be confeſſed, which leave out the Teſtimony of theſe three Witneſſes that ſpeak from Heaven, not reading the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Verſe; as is noted not only by <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers, but by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:204181:16"/>
                        <hi>Eraſmus, Grotius, Curcellaeus,</hi> and our Learned <hi>Selden,</hi> whoſe collections to this purpoſe far exceed all former obſervations. But yet this laſt named Great Author, hath ſaid ſo much

                     </p>
                     <p>And if any body ſhall ſay, What need is there of this in a Chriſtian Country? There are no Infidels ſure among us; nor are we in danger to turn <hi>Pagans, Turks</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> who blaſpheme the Lord <hi>Jeſus?</hi> I ſhall not labour to ſtop <hi>their mouths,</hi> by caſting reproaches on <hi>others;</hi> nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the apoſtaſie which ſome think they have reaſon to lay to the charge of too many in this preſent untoward generation: But deſire them to take their Anſwer from S. <hi>John</hi> himſelf, in the <hi>thirteenth</hi> Verſe of this very Chapter: Where they will find that he thought it not unneceſſary <hi>to write
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:204181:17"/>theſe things to them that believe on the name of the Son of God; that they might know how happy a thing it was to be a Chriſtian, and that they might believe</hi> (i. e. continue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) <hi>on the name of the Son of God.</hi> And I may modeſtly ſuppoſe, that what he thought good to aſſert here with ſo much care and exactneſs, it will not be thought an unprofitable diligence if I ſtudy to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and enlarge, for the benefit of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. It will be ſome ſatisfaction to me however, to have had it in my heart to do ſome honour to my Saviour, and to have endeavoured to make any part of his holy Book more clearly underſtood; eſpecially if what I write ſhall encreaſe the Faith of any Chriſtian Soul, and fill it with an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured hope in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by abiding conſtant in this belief, that <hi>he is the Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That being the thing which is to be proved by theſe witneſſes, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſearch a little into the meaning of the Phraſe, before we take their exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation about it. And it muſt be confeſſed, that though <hi>Jeſus</hi> be the <hi>Eternal Son of the Father, God of God, begotten of him before all Worlds;</hi> yet this is not always meant when he is called <hi>his Son:</hi> which is a name in the holy ſtile, not ſo much expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:204181:17"/>his Nature as his high Authority and Sovereign power, which he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as the Mediator between him and us, from God the Father Almighty. So I think we are here to underſtand the Apoſtle, who under the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all that belongs to his perſon, both his Divine and Humane nature; and affirms that this perſon hath Sovereign Authority committed to him by God the Father of all: who hath given him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and deputed him in his ſtead to declare his mind, and acquaint us with his will; and, having by himſelf purged our ſins, promoted him to ſit down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high, as that great King and Lord of all, by whom we are to be governed now, and to be judged at the laſt day. Sure I am, in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the holy Scripture which ſay, <hi>he is the Son of God,</hi> the meaning is expounded in other places to be this; that <hi>he is the Chriſt,</hi> or the anointed of God. That is, <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> roſe again from the dead, and afterward appointed S. <hi>John</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, to preach thoſe things to all Nations which we read in the holy Goſpel; was indeed ſent of God
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:204181:18"/>(according to the ancient Prophecies) with his own power and authority, and is now, by the ſuffering of death, crowned with glory and honour, to be our King and Sovereign Lord, whom we are all to obey, and from whom alone we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect all our rewards.</p>
                     <p>And there is great reaſon to think that theſe are phraſes of the very ſame import, here in S. <hi>John,</hi> if we compare but the <hi>firſt</hi> Verſe of this Chapter with the <hi>fifth.</hi> In the former we read, that <hi>whoſoever belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God:</hi> In the latter he tells us, that <hi>he who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the world, believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God.</hi> It is the very ſame Faith no doubt whereby we are <hi>born of God,</hi> and whereby we <hi>overcome the world;</hi> and therefore it is the very ſame thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Jeſus is the Chriſt,</hi> and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Jeſus is the Son of God.</hi> Expreſs it how you pleaſe, either of theſe ways, this alone is the Faith which can regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a man and put a Divine Spirit into him; that is, make him a conqueror over the world as <hi>Jeſus</hi> was. Let the <hi>ſecond</hi> Chapter of this Epiſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted alſo, and there you will find, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> are terms equivalent,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:204181:18"/>and have the ſame ſignification. To which if you add ſome places in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, they will make you ſee this more evidently. When S. <hi>Peter</hi> made this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, xvi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was <hi>Chriſt the Son of the living God,</hi> there is no more meant, one would think, by thoſe words, <hi>the Son of God,</hi> than what the other word, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> includes: becauſe when our Saviour would have them know that it was not fit for them, as yet, to divulge this truth which S. <hi>Peter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, he only charges his Diſciples (<hi>ver.</hi> 20.) that they ſhould tell no man that he was <hi>Jeſus the Chriſt.</hi> And if this be not ground enough to conclude the identity (as we ſpeak) of theſe words, the other Evangeliſts will put it out of doubt. For S. <hi>Mark</hi> makes the confeſſion of S. <hi>Peter</hi> to have been no more than this, <hi>Thou art the Chriſt,</hi> viii. 29. And S. <hi>Luke</hi> relates it not much otherwiſe, when he ſays that he acknowledged our Saviour to be <hi>the Chriſt of God,</hi> ix. 20. To be the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or to be the <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>Chriſt of God,</hi> or the <hi>Son of God,</hi> according to the underſtanding of theſe Divine writers, is the very ſame; and in theſe places nothing different. And indeed, it is very probable that S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> opinion is true, who believed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:204181:19"/>that the Apoſtles were not yet ſuch profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients as to underſtand the eternal genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> from the eſſence of the Father. For we find them very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of divers things that were eaſier to be learnt than this, which if they had known, they would not have expected to ſee him ſettle his Throne upon Earth, nor doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his Reſurrection from the dead, and many other things, as they did.</p>
                     <p>But the comparing of two other places will make this ſtill more manifeſt. In the xxvi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 63. we read that the High Prieſt adjured our Saviour to tell him, if he were <hi>the Chriſt, the Son of God.</hi> They all expected one to appear under this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; This was the common title of that great perſon, who they believed would ſhortly come: But they meant no more by it, than one appointed by God to be their King, as is apparent from S. <hi>Luke,</hi> who relates that queſtion barely thus; xxii. 67. <hi>Art thou the Chriſt? tell us.</hi> And after our Saviour had made that anſwer which we read both in him and S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew;</hi> he tells us (<hi>ver.</hi> 70.) they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied again, <hi>Art thou then the Son of God?</hi> which was no more than to ſay, muſt we take this for confeſſed then, that thou af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:204181:19"/>thy ſelf to be ſent, anointed, and ſet over us by God? Wilt thou ſtand to that which thou juſt now ownedſt, when we asked thee that queſtion? For without all doubt the Chief Prieſts and the Scribes intended nothing by that phraſe, <hi>the Son of God,</hi> but what was comprehended in the other, <hi>the Chriſt.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Pilate,</hi> upon their accuſation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined him upon the ſame matter, he asks nothing elſe but this (as this Apoſtle S. <hi>John</hi> relates, xviii. 33.) <hi>Art thou the King of the Jews?</hi> which is the plain interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word, <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For that is not the proper name of any perſon, as <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">

L.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.</note> rightly obſerves, but a <hi>name of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and dominion,</hi> ſignifying him to be their Sovereign: For in this ſtile, ſays he, the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to ſpeak of their Kings, whom they called <hi>Chriſts,</hi> or Gods anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>Once more, when they were enraged at our Saviour for calling himſelf the <hi>Son of God</hi> (as S. <hi>John</hi> tells us, Chap. x.) He juſtifies himſelf by a reaſon which ſignifies no more, but that he called himſelf, <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> the anointed of God, as you may read, <hi>ver.</hi> 34, 35, 36. If they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gods</hi> in old time, <hi>to whom the Word of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:204181:20"/>God came</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> who received commiſſion and authority from God to be the Judges and Rulers of his people) then it could be no offence, much leſs a <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> for him whom God had <hi>ſanctified (i. e.</hi> ſet apart and anointed to this office of being their Lord and King) to call himſelf the <hi>Son of God.</hi> For ſo he was by his place; and there was no need he ſhould ſay any thing of the Divine nature that was in him. Well then, to be the <hi>Son of God</hi> and to be <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> being but different expreſſions of the ſame thing; and the word <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſignifying <hi>anointed,</hi> one ſet apart to an high office, and (in its eminent ſence) that perſon who was to ſuſtain the place of God in this world, to be the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yea the Governour and Ruler of all mankind; we muſt conclude that when the Apoſtle ſays here, <hi>Jeſus is the Son of God,</hi> his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that He is the Holy one of God, the perſon whom he ſanctified by the unction of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſent into the World; to whom he hath now given all power in Heaven and in Earth, that every knee ſhould bow to him as the Sovereign Lord of the World; whom we are to hear and obey and depend upon in all things.</p>
                     <p>For this is the ſtile you may obſerve of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:204181:20"/>the Old Teſtament (from whence you may learn the riſe and original of this manner of ſpeech) which calls thoſe Kings, who derived their authority immediately from God, by the name of <hi>his Sons.</hi> Becauſe when they were anointed by his order, they were made what they were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and begotten (as they ſpoke) again: And being created by God to their new dignity, they are therefore called his Sons. The firſt time we meet with the phraſe, is in the ſtory of the firſt King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xiii. 1. where <hi>Saul</hi> is called, as the words are in the <hi>Hebrew, the Son of one year in his Kingdom.</hi> Becauſe there was but a year paſſed ſince the time of his uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by which he was born Gods Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and (as you read x. 6.) <hi>turned into another man.</hi> And indeed we find this imitated in Ethnick writers, who call the day their Emperors entred upon their Reign, their <hi>Birth-day.</hi> So we read in <hi>Spartianus</hi> that <hi>Adrian</hi> being informed by Letters that <hi>Trajan</hi> had named him for his Succeſſor, cauſed the <hi>birth-day of his adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be celebrated. And two days after, hearing of his death, he ordered they ſhould keep <hi>the birth-day of his Empire</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Natalem imperii in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituit cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandum.</note>. But I do not intend to launch out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtory, where we find this more plainly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:204181:21"/>delivered in the Hiſtory of the ſucceeding Kings of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For when the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and other neighbouring People with their Princes, conſpired (after they had been conquered by <hi>David</hi>) againſt the <hi>Lord</hi> and againſt his <hi>anointed;</hi> reſolving to caſt off their yoke: the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſhews (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.) how vain and idle their attempt would prove, becauſe God had appointed him, whom he ſent a Prophet to anoint, to be his King. This decree of God he averrs, and openly declares (<hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7.) that the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> when he anointed him) <hi>I have begotten thee.</hi> So that to riſe againſt him, was to war with God Almighty, whoſe <hi>Son,</hi> that is, Vicegerent he was in thoſe Countries. And therefore if they were well adviſed he exhorts them all to go and <hi>kiſs the Son, ver.</hi> 12. <hi>i. e.</hi> ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by that token of humble ſubjection, to him who had his Authority immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God: Nay, was <hi>his firſt-born,</hi> the moſt eminent Prince, that is, that ever he made, lxxxix. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. And therefore he was the prime type of our Lord Chriſt, to whom theſe words are applied, becauſe he was the <hi>Son of David,</hi> that great King, who was to <hi>reign over them for ever,</hi> as the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:204181:21"/>Angel ſaid, i. <hi>Luke</hi> 33. And if you paſs from hence to the next King, <hi>Solomon,</hi> (who had a particular unction alſo, and in whoſe reign was prefigured the glorious Kingdom of our Saviour) you will find that God ſays by a Prophet concerning him, <hi>I will be his Father, and he ſhall be my Son,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> vii. 14. Which words are a promiſe to make <hi>Solomon</hi> King, and ſettle him on the Throne of his Father <hi>David.</hi> So He underſtood it, as appears by the ſpeech which <hi>David</hi> made, not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, to all the great men of his Kingdom, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxviii. where he tells them (<hi>ver.</hi> 4.) that as <hi>Jeſſe</hi> had many Sons, <hi>Yet God liked him only to make him King over all Iſrael:</hi> So of the many Sons which the Lord had given him (<hi>ver.</hi> 5.) <hi>He had choſen Solomon to ſit upon the Throne of the Kingdom of the Lord.</hi> As is evident; ſaith he, from thoſe words of God ſpoken by <hi>Nathan</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 6.) <hi>I have choſen him to be my SON, and I will be hit FATHER, i. e.</hi> made choice of him to be King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in thy room, and as I have been to thee, ſo I will be to him. Thus <hi>Solomon,</hi> one would think, interpreted theſe words, when he prays God, who had made good one part of his promiſe, to perform the other alſo, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> i. 8, 9. <hi>Thou haſt ſhewed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:204181:22"/>great mercy unto David my Father, and haſt made me reign in his stead</hi> (as much as to ſay, <hi>made me thy Son</hi>) <hi>now, O Lord God let thy promiſe unto my Father be eſtabliſhed;</hi> that is, of being <hi>a Father to me,</hi> now that I am become thy ſon, and ſet by thee over a people, <hi>like the duſt of the Earth in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this time I ſuppoſe it will be no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to any intelligent perſon, that theſe Kings are called the <hi>Sons of God;</hi> who did not only govern in that Country, which was called, it is well known, <hi>God's land,</hi> and the inhabitants whereof were his <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people:</hi> but were appointed by his ſpecial direction, and <hi>anointed with his holy oil</hi> (lxxxix. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.) and had, as it were, their being and birth from God, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted them to <hi>ſit upon his Throne,</hi> and to be <hi>Kings for the Lord God,</hi> as you read 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> ix. 8. ſo that the Kingdom it ſelf is called in that Book <hi>the Kingdom of the Lord,</hi> xiii. 8. And the Judges alſo in the Courts of that Kingdom are ſaid to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the <hi>Judgment of the Lord</hi> and not of man (xix. 6.) that is, to ſit there in God's ſtead, to do men juſtice: And becauſe of this great power and truſt committed to them by him, are called, as you heard
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:204181:22"/>lxxxii. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1, 6. <hi>Gods, and the children of the most High;</hi> whoſe deputies they were, and for whom they judged. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the leſs wonder, that when this Great Prince came among them, to whom <hi>all judgment is committed,</hi> and who hath <hi>all power in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> and is <hi>Lord of all,</hi> and <hi>appointed by God the heir of all things,</hi> He is called by the ſame name that they were. If there were no other reaſon for it, his office would give him a title to it: becauſe he is the <hi>Lords Chriſt,</hi> anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God to the higheſt dignity and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under him, not only over that Country, but over all Nations on the Earth; who, by believing on him, were all to be made a <hi>choſen generation, a royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 9. But to ſhow his moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent greatneſs he is called the <hi>Son of God,</hi> with two marks of his preeminence above all other who have had that name: Firſt, he is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>that Son,</hi> that eminent King, the King of Kings; like to whom none ever was. For, ſecondly, whereas thoſe <hi>ſons of the higheſt</hi> ſpoken of before, were to <hi>die like</hi> other <hi>men,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.7.</note> and to fall like one of the Princes,</hi> in other Countries, He is called the Son, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>of that God who liveth,</hi> xvi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. that is,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:204181:23"/>of the immortal eternal God: And by conſequence is like his Father, an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King, <hi>of whoſe Kingdom,</hi> as the Angel told his Mother, i. <hi>Luke</hi> 33. <hi>there ſhall be no end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who underſtood this language well enough, hath diſcourſed in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Chapter. Where he proves that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Son of God</hi> in a more eminent ſence than any Angel in Heaven, according to thoſe ancient prophecies before named, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> as you read <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. From whence the <hi>Jews</hi> learns to call the Meſſiah, who they confeſs is in thoſe places myſtically ſpoken of, by that name of the <hi>Son of God.</hi> Which the Apoſtle there ſhows is the greateſt name of excellence, and ſignifies the higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity; ſuch as God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon no other. And then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to ſhow, that according to other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies which ſpeak of his ſupereminence <hi>his Throne is for ever and ever:</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 8.) For <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>his God</hi> (in a peculiar manner loving and rewarding him) <hi>hath anointed him with the oil of gladneſs</hi> (prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that is) <hi>above all that partake of Kingly dignity, ver.</hi> 9. He hath made him
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:204181:23"/>indeed his <hi>firſt-born, the Prince of all the Kings of the Earth</hi> (as S. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, i. <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.) to whom we are to ſubmit our ſelves with the greateſt devotion of ſpirit, and from whom we may then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Protection, Bleſſing, and the nobleſt Rewards. For he is the long expected <hi>Son of God,</hi> who excells all other that were ever called by that name; the <hi>King</hi> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable Majeſty, whoſe ſplendor could not ſo much as be fore-ſhadowed by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in all his glory. Thus <hi>Nathanael</hi> I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve puts theſe two expreſſions together, in his confeſſion of our Saviour, out of a vehement affection redoubling his words, <hi>Thou art that Son of God, thou art that King of Iſrael,</hi> i. John 49.</p>
                     <p>This is the buſineſs upon which we are to examine theſe <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what they ſay to this point, that the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> was ſent from God as <hi>Moſes</hi> had formerly been: only <hi>Moſes</hi> as a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> but he as a <hi>Son</hi> (according to what you read, iii. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5, 6.) with a fulneſs of authority, with all the power of God; ſo that we may confidently rely on every thing that he hath ſaid, as the very mind and ſence of God. This if we can hear them ſpeak, they are witneſſes ſo beyond
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:204181:24"/>all exception, that we cannot chuſe but reverence him, and receive him, and obey him, and put our truſt in him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his royal favour and love ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. For the firſt three are no leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons than the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Whoſe gracious aſſiſtance let us humbly implore, that this and all other our works may be begun, continued and ended, to the glorifying of his holy Name.</p>

                        <p>O that none of the inticing allurements of this world may ever more deceive us, and steal away our hearts from our true happineſs: nor any of the troubleſome paſſages of this life ever hereafter diſhearten us, and divert us from the purſuit of it: But the Faith of Chriſt may ſo intirely poſſeſs our hearts, as to keep us stedfaſt and upright, in the midſt of all the temptations, of what kind ſoever they be, that aſſault us. And looking up unto <hi>Jeſus</hi> the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and finiſher of our Faith, we may still ſay with true reſolution of ſpirit, Thou art the Son of God most high, thou art the King of incomprehenſible Majeſty, thou art the Lord of all. We will conſtantly adhere to thee, as thy faithful ſubjects. We will follow thee in faith and love, and patient obedience to the very death. And hope that as we feel, by thy

                     </head>
                     <p>IF any man urge us to receive a thing which is new and ſtrange, we either turn away our ears, if we take him for a frivolous perſon, or elſe require him to ſhow us good evidence for what he ſays, if he ſeem to be wiſe and ſerious. And the more importunate he is to be believed, the more earneſt we are to know what he hath to ſhow for himſelf, and to call for his proofs: in which if he fail or they come not home to the purpoſe, he is ſo far from gaining any credit with thoſe who exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them, that they prove a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable argument againſt him. Eſpecially when he pretends to come from God, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:204181:26"/>to bring us meſſages from Heaven, we all expect the clearer and diviner demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, before we can reſign our mind unto him. For that which is to make all things credible, muſt have very pregnant Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons accompanying it to win credit to it ſelf. If that which ſtands as a reaſon for all that a man ſays, be not it ſelf grounded upon the cleareſt and moſt undeniable, it turns againſt him and proves nothing but a confutation of all that it was brought to aſſert.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Jeſus</hi> pretending not only to this honour of <hi>coming from God</hi> (which is a ſufficient Argument for any thing that he ſays in his Name) but alſo to an higher Dignity of being <hi>his Son;</hi> and ſo of being privy to all his ſecrets, of lying in his very boſom, and being inveſted with a power equal to the Almighties; if He and his Apoſtles (who affirmed the ſame of him, after he was put to death, and that as a Malefactor) ſhould be defective in their proofs of ſo lofty and weighty a pretenſion, <hi>He</hi> would be rendred of all other the moſt contemptible, and they become men moſt ridiculous, for obtruding him on the world in ſuch a quality, upon ſlight or no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations. For the greater and more
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:204181:26"/>concerning any Aſſertion is, which we propound to mens belief, the ſtronger and more plentiful Arguments they juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to induce a perſwaſion. Which if they be wanting, it is ſo far from being a fault not to ſurrender their Souls to that propoſition; that it is a vertue to refuſe admittance, and they could not excuſe themſelves from a great guilt, ſhould they be ſo eaſie as to let it find entertainment. Nay, it is a commendable piece of caution and warineſs, to <hi>ſuſpend</hi> our belief in a matter of very great importance, though there be ſome conſiderable proofs offered; if they be not proportionable to the weight of the thing, unto which we are to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up no leſs than our Souls.</p>
                     <p>Let us ſee therefore what evidence this Follower and Favourite (as I may call him) of <hi>Jeſus</hi> produces and lays before us, to make good this, which he preached for a certain truth; that He is no leſs than the <hi>Son of God.</hi> Let us hear what his <hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſay, for ſo he calls his proofs, to this great point; and conſider whether they ſpeak ſo home to it, that we cannot reaſonably refuſe to believe it. The office of a <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is to give in all the evidence he can for the clearing of any matter in queſtion;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:204181:27"/>for this very end, that there by the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie may be decided upon his credit. When the Apoſtle therefore calls for his <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> who are ready he ſaith to juſtifie this which he aſſerts, if any body make a doubt of it, or be not well ſetled in this belief; his meaning is, that it relies upon ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid grounds, that no man ſhall be able to deny <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the <hi>only begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> the <hi>Chriſt of God;</hi> unleſs he can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Authority of his witneſſes, which he was ſure would never be in any mans power to do, they were of ſuch known verity. If this be called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether <hi>Jeſus</hi> be the <hi>Son of God</hi> or no, if any liſt to bring it to trial, and examine it before the bar of impartial Reaſon; S. <hi>John</hi> here offers his <hi>witneſſes,</hi> faithful and juſt, of undoubted Truth and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, who ſhall make it good: So that if you will hear them, and conſider what they ſay, and then give ſentence according to their evidence, you muſt needs judge that he is what he ſaid he was, The Son of God moſt high; and quit him in your Conſciences of all the calumnies &amp; aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſaid he was a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the people.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>witneſſes</hi> that he brings, you
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:204181:27"/>ſee, dwell in two very diſtant places; <hi>three</hi> of them in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and the other <hi>three</hi> in the <hi>Earth.</hi> From theſe two ſeveral regions they give their Teſtimony; the former from above, the later here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. For when the Apoſtle ſays that there are <hi>three,</hi>

                        </gap>, <hi>on the Earth;</hi> the meaning is not that the Firſt three gave their teſtimony to thoſe that are in Heaven, and the laſt three to thoſe that are on Earth: but that the Firſt three <hi>witneſſes</hi> are themſelves in Heaven, and the other three were on Earth, and ſo from thence they gave their teſtimony to <hi>Jeſus.</hi> They that dwell in Heaven deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their teſtimony and juſtified this Truth from above, and the other reſiding on the Earth did there ſpeak to it, and make it good. Let us firſt hear theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and Heavenly <hi>witneſſes,</hi> and take under examination what they declare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him whom we acknowledge for our Lord, and what Authority he hath, according to their teſtimony, to exact all obedience of us, as he is the <hi>Son of God.</hi> And firſt of all let us begin with the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>FATHER:</hi> for the truth is, that as he is the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and the Beginning
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:204181:28"/>of all things, ſo he did firſt teſtifie of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> and by his voice from Heaven pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed him to be his <hi>Son,</hi> before He, or any elſe was ſo bold as to affirm it. And as he being the <hi>Firſt,</hi> did bear witneſs to him, before any of the reſt ſpoke a word; ſo, according to the number of theſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly witneſſes, He gave his Teſtimony of him <hi>three</hi> times.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>first</hi> time was when our Saviour began to appear publickly among the people; coming out of his privacy, <hi>from Nazareth of Galilee to be baptized of John in Jordan.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Matt. 3.13. Mark 1.9.</note> He had no need indeed of that Baptiſm, as <hi>John</hi> affirmed and our Saviour did not deny: but as became one who had put himſelf into the ſtate of our meanneſs, and appeared in our ſinful fleſh, he would omit nothing that belonged to the duty of a pious perſon. And therefore he would have the Baptiſt do to him as he did to others, knowing that he exerciſed this Miniſtry by the appointment of God; whoſe inſtitutions ought to be reverenced, and to whoſe will all good men ought to conform themſelves. Now he had no ſooner given this example of humble obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:204181:28"/>but as he came out of the Water, God the Father of Heaven declared him in expreſs terms to be what S. <hi>John</hi> here ſays he was, his <hi>only Son.</hi> Which teſtimony of his is recorded by no leſs than <hi>three Evangeliſts,</hi> as you may find if you read iii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. i. <hi>Mark</hi> 11. iii. <hi>Luke.</hi> 22. who tells us that he ſaw the Heavens at that time, opened to him, and a Divine Glory come from thence and ſettle upon him, which was followed with a voice from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> So S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> reports the words of God the <hi>FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER</hi> (from whom this voice came, it is plain, becauſe he calls <hi>Jeſus</hi> his <hi>Son</hi>) or as they may be rendred more emphatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>This is that Son of mine, that beloved one</hi> (whom the Prophets promiſed, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly xlii. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1. God would ſend to them, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> well expounds it) who is moſt dear to me, and ſhall declare my whole will and pleaſure. There is a mark ſet before it, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, lo, or behold; that we may all attend and liſten diligently to this voice: for now <hi>the word of God came to him</hi> (as he ſpeaks in another place, I told you, concerning thoſe who were called Gods under the old Law, x. <hi>John</hi> 35.) and in an audible manner authorized him, to begin
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:204181:29"/>to act as the Chriſt of God, whom He had anointed, as you ſhall hear, with the Holy Ghoſt, juſt at this moment, when He declared him his Son, by this voice from Heaven.</p>
                        <p>Which, if you carefully obſerve it, is expreſſed by the other Evangeliſts in ſuch a manner, that we may underſtand it was directed to himſelf; as that commiſſion which was ſent him from Heaven, to give him power to exerciſe the office of Gods ſupreme and only Miniſter in this world; in whom alone he was well pleaſed, and in none elſe, but by him. For S. <hi>Mark</hi> ſays the voice was in theſe words, <hi>Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> Which plainly tell us that he ſpake <hi>to Jeſus</hi> (and not merely <hi>of</hi> him) that he might be confident He was the perſon whom God had now <hi>ſanctified and ſent into the world.</hi> And ſo S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath recorded it more fully and expreſly, <hi>Thou art my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, in thee I am well pleaſed.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Thou art the perſon to whom I have a favour above all others. I have anointed thee above all thy fellows: none that have had this name, are ſo dear to me as thou art; to whom I commit my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and inveſt with my power, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:204181:29"/>intruſt with all my mind and will.</p>
                        <p>Now becauſe we all ſuſpect private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, and think it no ſufficient ground to believe one that ſays God ſpake to him, unleſs he can bring ſome other very credible perſon beſides himſelf to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that he alſo heard it, or be able other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to demonſtrate it; God was pleaſed therefore, not only by other means to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie this, but ſo to direct S. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s pen, that he hath as good as told us, that the voice which was directed to <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf (telling him he was his Son) was uttered likewiſe in the audience of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> a perſon famed for his ſanctity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced by all the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and acknowledged to be a Prophet. Though it was delivered I believe in thoſe words and ſyllables wherein S. <hi>Mark</hi> or S. <hi>Luke</hi> have ſet it down, for as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were opened <hi>unto him</hi> (iii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.) and <hi>he</hi> ſaw the Spirit deſcending, ſo the voice which accompanied it, ſpake in all likelihood unto him; yet it being heard alſo by <hi>John,</hi> who had baptiſed him, and who ſaw all that went before it as he himſelf declared, it was as if God had ſaid to him, <hi>This is my beloved Son,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore ſo S. <hi>Matthew</hi> relates it. The
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:204181:30"/>Father Almighty by this voice awakened the attention of the Baptiſt, and bade him, as it were, mark it, that this perſon to whom he now ſpake was the Meſſiah; who now entred upon his office, being declared the Son of God, and ſhould <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi> and grow (as he preſently after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, iii. <hi>John</hi> 30.) till he came to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Reſurrection from the dead, <hi>the Son of God with power</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, i. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.) that is, with all the power belonging to his office, of Lord of all things, the great King of Heaven and Earth.</p>
                        <p>Till this time he knew no more of <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> but that he was coming, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ordered him to make way for him; and that he ſhould immediately appear, and be ſo much ſuperior to him (iii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.) that he ſhould not be worthy to be one of his meaneſt ſervants: His counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he was not acquainted withall, nor could he ſay, this is the perſon, when he met with him, as he himſelf confeſſes, i. <hi>John</hi> 31. But thus much he was told by him that ſent him to Baptize, as he there declares, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. that on whom he ſhould ſee the Spirit deſcend and remain, he ſhould conclude that perſon was the Meſſiah,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:204181:30"/>from whom they might expect the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, which had been ſo long a ſtranger to their Nation. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, having ſome intimation of him from the Spirit, as ſoon as <hi>Jeſus</hi> offered himſelf to receive his Baptiſm (iii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.) immediately after he was confirmed in his belief that this was the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the former ſign (i. <hi>John</hi> 32.) And thereupon publiſhes it openly to all in theſe words, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. <hi>I ſaw and bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> gave my teſtimony of him) <hi>that this is the Son of God.</hi> So God himſelf taught him to call our Saviour; for it ſhould ſeem by the words of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that he had this further ground to believe it, and ſo was furniſhed with greater abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to teſtifie it; that he <hi>heard</hi> the voice from Heaven as well as <hi>ſaw</hi> the Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend upon him. Though the Father ſpake the words to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> yet it was in the preſence and hearing of this perſon (who was <hi>ſent from God to be his witneſs,</hi> i. <hi>John</hi> 6, 7.) and as if he had ſaid to him, <hi>This is my beloved Son;</hi> mind what I ſay; go and teſtifie that this is He in whom I delight above all others. Thou mayeſt be ſure of it, for I tell thee ſo, who gave thee all the Authority thou haſt. And accordingly you read that he went and did his office,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:204181:31"/>for which he was ſent; that is, <hi>He bare witneſs of him, and cried, ſaying, This was he of whom I ſpake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me; for he was before me,</hi> 1. <hi>John</hi> 15. which he repeats in the ſame Chapter as his <hi>record</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 19.) in behalf of our Saviour, on two other occaſions, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. and 30. to let them know that the perſon of whom he gave this teſtimony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was baptiſed of him, was now come, and exalted to a far higher dignity than himſelf, being a more <hi>mighty</hi> perſon, as the reſt of the Evangeliſts ſpeak, no leſs than the <hi>Son of God.</hi> This he means by being <hi>preferred before him,</hi> appointed by the Father of all to an incomparably more excellent office which he entred upon after the preaching and baptiſm of <hi>John;</hi> who began indeed his Miniſtry before <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but it was not becauſe he was greater, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe he was leſs, and came to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his way, who was, as he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the <hi>firſt</hi> of the two; not only in regard of his Divine Nature, but in regard of his ſublime office, into which he was now put, by being pronounced, <hi>the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son of God,</hi> by this voice from Heaven.</p>
                        <p>Which the Devil himſelf, one would think heard, and underſtood to be ſuch a teſtimony concerning <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:204181:31"/>the greateſt Miniſtry to him, and was a Divine warrant to go in Gods name to the world, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> after the Angel ſpake to him out of the buſh, did to the <hi>Jews.</hi> And therefore when immediately after this our Saviour was led by the Spirit into the wilderneſs, the Devil would have had him give ſome proof of his Divine power, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, or rather ſhow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by a greater evidence than <hi>Moſes</hi> gave, to be greater than he: that he might be ſatisfied <hi>Jeſus</hi> was no leſs than the voice declared him, the <hi>Son of God.</hi> So you read iv. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. that the firſt thing he ſaid to him was, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, command that theſe stones be made bread.</hi> As much as to ſay, Thou art now in a ſtarving condition (for he had taken no proviſion with him into the wilderneſs, reſolving to depend on that God who had expreſſed ſuch love to him, as to own him for his Son) here is a fit opportunity for thee to exerciſe thy power, if thou haſt any, by bidding theſe ſtones turn into loaves, which will be a greater wonder than <hi>Moſes</hi> his bringing Manna out of the clouds, and ſhow indeed that thou art God's Son. To which our Saviour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, as you read in the next Verſe, out of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf (viii. <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.) and tells
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:204181:32"/>him he might learn from that ſtory of the Manna, there was no need he ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his power, which God had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, on this faſhion; for as the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> were maintained in the wilderneſs after a miraculous manner, ſo might He: who would prove himſelf to be his Son, not this way by turning ſtones into bread, but by truſting in God, and leaving him to provide for him as he thought good. That's his meaning when he ſays, <hi>Man ſhall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> And ſo in the following temptations he ſtill held to this, that he was ſufficiently ſatisfied he was God's Son, and would not demand any farther proof of it, but ſuch as he himſelf would give, who at laſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. ordered the <hi>Angels to go and miniſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</hi> To carry him food, it is like, and congratulate this his firſt victory over the enemy of mankind. Who was not ſo dull, but he learnt by this and many other things afterward, wherein he felt his power, that this voice from Heaven was no vain rumour, no empty inſignificant ſound, but a true report of the very mind of Almighty God: which he himſelf was forced to proclaim as loudly as any body elſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:204181:32"/>For you find him, not long after this, with a whole Legion of his companions, acknowledging <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be <hi>the Son of God moſt high,</hi> and with humble proſtrations <hi>worſhipping him,</hi> whom he had the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before to perſwade to worſhip him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>crying with a loud voice for Gods ſake that he would not torment him,</hi> v. <hi>Mark</hi> 6, 7, 8. viii. <hi>Luke</hi> 28. Nay, he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, one would think, of this as ſoon as ever that temptation was ended. For you read that immediately after it, <hi>Jeſus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee,</hi> iv. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. and there at <hi>Capernaum</hi> met with a man that had <hi>a ſpirit of an unclean Devil,</hi> who <hi>cried out with a loud voice, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God, ver.</hi> 34. which is thus interpreted, <hi>ver.</hi> 41. The Devils came out of many, crying out, and ſaying, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of God: For they knew that he was Chriſt.</hi> But our Saviour would not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to them for their ſuffrage; it was ſufficient that God had declared him his Son, and that <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt atteſted as much, and that the <hi>works which he did</hi> (particularly his diſpoſſeſſing them of their ſtrongeſt holds) <hi>bare witneſs of him.</hi> And therefore he impoſed ſilence on them,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:204181:33"/>as the Evangeliſt there tells us; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might by their loud acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him, give the <hi>Phariſees</hi> occaſion to calumniate him, who were too forward to ſay he had confederacy with the Devil; and becauſe it was not fit this ſhould be publiſhed in ſo many words, no not by his Apoſtles (xvi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.) till after his Reſurrection and his Aſcenſion to the Throne of his glory, and the coming of the Holy Ghoſt; which demonſtrated he was completely <hi>made both Lord and Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtles then openly declared, ii. <hi>Acts</hi> 36.</p>
                        <p>But till then it ſeems to have been the work of the <hi>Father</hi> alone or principally to bear witneſs of him: for <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt was his <hi>voice crying in the wilderneſs,</hi> and the works our Saviour did were thoſe which his <hi>Father had given him to finiſh,</hi> and the Spirit was the <hi>Finger of God,</hi> which poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men to him, as I may ſo ſpeak, and bid them receive him as his <hi>beloved Son in whom he was well pleaſed.</hi> And ſhall we not receive this for the greateſt Truth, when God himſelf ſays it? ſhall we not let <hi>him</hi> diſpoſe of our Faith? is not He the Truth? is it poſſible for <hi>him</hi> to falſifie or deceive? or do we imagine He cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

He that formed the mouth, cannot He ſpeak? is his power leſs than ours? can we manifeſt what we would have and make it underſtood, and cannot He in the ſame manner make us know his will and pleaſure? If his expreſs teſtimony then be of any force, here you have it, by an audible voice from Heaven: And <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, whom the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Enemies of our Saviour, durſt not but reverence, bare record to him thereupon, that <hi>Jeſus is the Son of God.</hi>

                        <p>This was in the Holy Mount, as you may read in the xvii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. and in the two following Evangeliſts, ix. <hi>Mark</hi> 7. ix. <hi>Luke</hi> 35. where the <hi>Father</hi> of all was pleaſed to declare in the ſame terms, as he had done at his Baptiſm, and with an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible voice, which aſtoniſhed thoſe that heard it (xvii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.) That he was his <hi>beloved Son, in whom he was well pleaſed:</hi> to which Declaration he added this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>HEAR HIM.</hi> That is, be aſſured that what he ſays to you, is the Truth; and what I ſpeak to the world, it ſhall be by his mouth. Now this voice was uttered in the hearing of no leſs than <hi>three</hi> perſons, whom our Saviour had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the reſt of his company, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him unto this Mountain, where God appeared to bear witneſs to him. Of which three, this Diſciple S. <hi>John</hi> was one; who therefore might with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confidence urge here the Teſtimony of the <hi>Father,</hi> which he himſelf heard. And unleſs they to whom he writes this Epiſtle could find him falſe, and guilty of forgery in any other relation, they had no reaſon to call in queſtion his honeſty and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:204181:34"/>in this report: which is the more conſiderable, becauſe there were others who heard it as well as he, who might be appealed unto, and askt about it.</p>
                        <p>One of thoſe who were there preſent and heard it together with him, was S. <hi>Peter;</hi> a man timorous enough, and apt to deny a <hi>Truth,</hi> and therefore of no ſuch courage as to ſupport a <hi>Lye,</hi> with the danger of his life. Who writing to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people, as S. <hi>John</hi> here doth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>this voice</hi> to them as a ſure witneſs of that Truth, which he was ſhortly to ſeal with his Bloud; and profeſſes his own ſincerity in the relating of it. Read with attention 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14, 15, 16, 17, 18. where he tells them that our Lord having ſhown him he muſt ſhortly die (when it is no time to diſſemble with God or Man) he would endeavour to ſettle in their minds ſuch a ſolid ground of faith, that, when he was gone, they ſhould ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken, if they did but remember it: And that it was not a thing he had received by hear-ſay, much leſs a deviſed ſtory that had been forged in his own brain; but a matter of which he was an <hi>eye and ear-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> of which he, and others alſo, had a certain, clear and perfect knowledge.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:204181:35"/>For they ſaw then the glory wherein <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> was, and they heard the forenamed voice come from that excellent glory, which could be no other but the glory of the Father. Then, and there in that Mount, <hi>Jeſus received from the Father ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory,</hi> when there came forth from the mouth of God this voice, in all their hearing; <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here it will be neceſſary to take notice, that the voice, as all of them relate it, was directed not to him, but to thoſe who were there preſent with him. None of them ſay, that it ſpake thus, <hi>THOU art my beloved Son,</hi> &amp;c. (according as S. <hi>Mark</hi> and S. <hi>Lake</hi> report the former voice) but they unanimouſly tell us in theſe <hi>four</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which I have named, that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the other form, <hi>THIS is my beloved Son,</hi> &amp;c. As if He ſpake to the company that attended him, and bade them obſerve that here He owned this perſon to ſtand in ſuch a relation to him, as he and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had profeſſed. The former voice might come for his ſake; but there being no need of <hi>his</hi> further ſatisfaction, this was for <hi>theirs;</hi> that they might ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly believe, and that they might be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:204181:35"/>competent witneſſes of him, and perſwade others to the belief of that, which upon their own certain knowledge they could affirm, was the very mind and will of God. I ſhall have occaſion hereafter to make a further enquiry into both theſe Teſtimonies which the Father gave to his Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and therefore I ſhall now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs them with ſome obſervations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this: which will much help to illuſtrate it, and add to the force of it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, that our Saviour having at this time ſequeſtred himſelf, with three of his Apoſtles, into an high mountain to pray to God, was <hi>transfigured before them as he was praying</hi> (xvii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. ix. <hi>Luke</hi> 29.) ſo that <hi>his face did ſhine as the Sun,</hi> and his very garments were all <hi>gliſtering.</hi>

For to <hi>ſhine as the Sun</hi> is a phraſe expreſſing ſomething belonging to celeſtial Majeſty in the Kingdom of the Father, xiii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 43. The white and ſplendid garments
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:204181:36"/>alſo, it were eaſie to ſhow, were proper to Kings and thoſe who waited on them, iii. <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. The Miniſters and royal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants in the Heavenly Court, were wont always to appear in ſuch radiant brightneſs; though ſhort of this wherein our Saviour now began to ſhine, as the King, ere long, of Heaven and Earth. For ſo S. <hi>John</hi> ſays, i. 14. <hi>We beheld his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the glory of the only begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And S. <hi>Peter</hi> when he ſpeaks of this ſays, 2 i. 16. <hi>We were eye-witneſſes of his MAJESTY.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of which, that they might be aſſured, this was a true repreſentation, you may obſerve, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> how they ſaw a very great Glory appear and approach towards them; called by S. <hi>Mark</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a <hi>Cloud,</hi> but by S. <hi>Matthew</hi> xvii. 5. a <hi>bright cloud:</hi> which had uſually been the token of the preſence of the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. And therefore it is called by S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the place before named (<hi>ver.</hi> 17.) <hi>the excellent or magnificent glory:</hi> and the voice which came out of it, is ſaid (<hi>ver.</hi> 18.) to come <hi>from Heaven,</hi> becauſe it came forth from the preſence of God, of which this <hi>bright cloud</hi> was the viſible ſign. For ſo He appeared anciently to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:204181:36"/>cloud that had a ſplendor or ſhining light in it, like to the hotteſt fire, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brightly gliſtered and ſometimes was obſcured. So you read, xix. <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. that <hi>the LORD deſcended in fire upon</hi> the famous <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and a little after, xxiv. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16, 17. how the <hi>glory of the Lord dwelt upon</hi> that <hi>Mount, and the cloud covered it</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the glory of the Lord) for the ſpace of <hi>ſix days:</hi> and then on <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day He called unto Moſes out of the midſt of that cloud:</hi> And the <hi>aſpect of the glory of the Lord was as fire that burnt or glowed with great ardency in the ſight of the children of Iſrael.</hi> That is, on the ſeventh day, that Glory was revealed and broke forth out of the cloud, wherein for ſix days it had been wrapped up and hidden from their ſight. And ſo you read in the xl. Chapter of that Book, that as ſoon as <hi>Moſes</hi> had reared up the Tabernacle for the conſtant habitation of this Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the <hi>cloud covered it,</hi> and reſted upon it without, and the <hi>glory of the Lord</hi> filled it within (<hi>ver.</hi> 34, 35.) which is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after explained to be <hi>a fire,</hi> which by night appeared <hi>upon the Tabernacle</hi> to guide them in their journey. This is that bright flame, which frighted them when they murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> called <hi>the glory
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:204181:37"/>of the Lord appearing in the cloud</hi> (xvi. <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.10. and xvi. <hi>Numb.</hi> 42.) threatning to devour them if they were not more obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Such a glory, but more pure and more delightful to behold, there was now upon this <hi>Holy Mount,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> calls it: to make them apprehenſive that now they were in the preſence of God; who as he did on that Mount (to ſpeak in the words of <hi>Tertullian</hi>) initiate their <hi>forefathers</hi> in the Religion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by ſhowing his glory and by his voice; ſo here on this

Nubes,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Tertullian</hi> there ſpeaks, a dumb cloud, a ſilent glory; but a voice came out of it, which was <hi>Novum Patris teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium ſuper filio,</hi> the Fathers New teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning his Son. In which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony He was pleaſed to apply thoſe very words to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which had been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning a Prophet whom he had bid them look for after him. For in the xviii. of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> he tells them from God himſelf (<hi>ver.</hi> 17.) that there ſhould be raiſed up to them a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:204181:37"/>like unto him, into <hi>whoſe mouth</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 18.) the Lord would <hi>put his own words,</hi> and <hi>who ſhould ſpeak all that he ſhould command him; UNTO HIM SHALL YE HEARKEN, ver.</hi> 15. as much as to ſay, Be ſure you attend to his words, and give obedience to them. Now theſe very words and ſyllables <hi>HEAR HIM,</hi> are, by that God who made that promiſe to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſpoken in this place to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples with a manifeſt application to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> clearly denoting him to be the perſon whom <hi>Moſes</hi> foretold the Lord their God would ſend, to declare his mind unto them, as he himſelf already had done. And that this was really the voice of God, as much as that voice which ſpake to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> we have the greater reaſon to conclude from this following, which is the <hi>fourth,</hi> obſervation.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Moſes</hi> now ſtood by and heard it: and from thence learnt a great deal more than he knew when he wrote his Book; that this perſon of whom he ſpoke was more than <hi>a Prophet:</hi> being the <hi>Son of Gods deareſt love.</hi> For theſe words which declared him ſo, were ſpoken there where he was preſent: who durſt not contradict them, as ſure he would have done, had he
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:204181:38"/>not known them to be the very voice of God and no deluſion.</p>
                        <p>I need not enlarge this; becauſe the Evangeliſts tell us ſo plainly, that not only He appeared in glory talking with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour upon this Mountain, but <hi>Elias</hi> alſo accompanied him, which is next to be conſidered. Who being a great Prophet might pretend as fairly as any other man, to be the perſon deſigned by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the words forenamed; and yet conſented by his ſilence to the ſame undoubted Truth, that the prophecy of <hi>Moſes</hi> was not till now fufilled, but had its utmoſt comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Jeſus.</hi> And indeed this voice from Heaven, making ſuch an open Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning <hi>Jeſus,</hi> before him that gave the Law, and before the chiefeſt of the Prophets who had aſſerted it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard by them with the profoundeſt ſilence, without any contradiction; it did as good as tell the Apoſtles that they might be aſſured this was He of whom the Law and the Prophets had ſpoken, whom they were now to give ear unto; and that the Law and the Prophets muſt from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth give way to an higher Revelation from God, by this <hi>Jeſus.</hi> If this had not been true, we cannot but think that this
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:204181:38"/>great Zealot <hi>Elias,</hi> who had been always ſo <hi>jealous for the Lord of hoſts,</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> xix. 14.) and this truſty ſervant of God, <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was ſo <hi>faithful in all his houſe</hi> (xii. <hi>Num.</hi> 7.) would have preſently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred their proteſtation againſt it; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Apoſtles in the Name of God, to give heed only to their voice, but not to this. Which now might the rather be believed to come from Heaven, becauſe theſe inſpired perſons reverence it, and dare not venture in the leaſt to ſpeak againſt it; when they were highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned ſo to do, if it had not been the voice of God.</p>
                        <p>And if any one ſhall ask, how theſe Diſciples could tell that theſe two were <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> whom they never ſaw; I think <hi>Theophylact</hi> hath well reſolved it: that they knew them not by their faces, but by their diſcourſe. Certain it is that perſons living in far diſtant Countries, known to others merely by their works and manner of writing, have, after a little converſe at an unexpected meeting, been challenged by the Names that their Books carried, without the help of any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted character in their face to diſtinguiſh them. Nothing is more common than the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:204181:39"/>ſtory of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> whom his Friend here in <hi>England</hi> greeted by his name, after a few repartees paſs'd between them; though he had never ſeen him, and little thought then to embrace him. Now we are expreſly told by all the <hi>three</hi> Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, that <hi>Moſes and Elias talked with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> and by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> that their diſcourſe was concerning his <hi>deceaſe</hi> or departure out of this world, which he ſhould accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and conſequently, it is very probable, of the glory that was to follow it by his Reſurrection. Which conference the Apoſtles hearing, they might eaſily know, though not <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, by their pictures, which many of that Nation held it unlawful to be made, yet <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, from their words and diſcourſe (wherein either <hi>Jeſus</hi> or they, before it was done, had occaſion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their Names or their offices, or to deſcribe their perſons) that they were none elſe but thoſe two men, who then appeared to them. And it is poſſible, as <hi>Theophylact</hi> adds, that <hi>Moſes</hi> might ſay, I acknowledge thee to be the perſon, whoſe death I prefigured, by the Lamb which was ſlain at the Paſſeover: And <hi>Elias</hi> might joyn with him and ſay, Thou art He whoſe Reſurrection I did likewiſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:204181:39"/>fore-ſhow, by calling again the Widow's ſon to life. Some ſuch kind of diſcourſe we may reaſonably conceive paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, whereby they diſcovered themſelves to be, the one the Law-giver, the other the nobleſt of all the Prophets: who now came to wait upon <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and acknowledge that he was greater than they; as the voice from Heaven preſently teſtified, which declared him the <hi>beloved Son of God,</hi> to whom now all muſt attend, as they had formerly done to them.</p>
                        <p>And therefore it is very remarkable (which is the laſt thing I ſhall obſerve) that no ſooner was this voice heard, but <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> vaniſhed and were ſeen no more. As much as to ſay, That <hi>Jeſus</hi> alone was now to be <hi>heard;</hi> the Law and the Prophets were gone, and had nothing to do, but only to ſerve him. So S. <hi>Mark</hi> relates, ix. 8. that <hi>ſuddenly when they had looked round about</hi> (after the hearing of this voice) <hi>they ſaw no man any more, ſave Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus only with themſelves.</hi> They turned their eyes every way to look for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> but there was no further news of them. Nay, S. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, ix. 36. that in the very uttering of the voice from that Heavenly glory, they diſappeared. So
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:204181:40"/>thoſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie, <hi>While the voice was ſpeaking, Jeſus was found alone.</hi> The clould out of which it came, covered them and took them into it. At the ſame time it opened it ſelf, to manifeſt him and to obſcure them: that it might be evident the voice ſpake of him alone and none elſe; there being no body but He to be ſeen by his Diſciples, when it came forth from the preſence of God. So you read in all the Evangeliſts, that the cloud which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>over-ſhadowed them</hi> (<hi>viz. Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>) whereupon <hi>the Diſciples were afraid</hi> (as S. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, ix. 34.) <hi>as they</hi> (that is, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>) <hi>entred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                              </gap>to the cloud:</hi> imagining it is like that it would approach nearer, and ſpread it ſelf over them; who dreaded to enter into it, as they ſaw thoſe two perſons did. But there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; it only parted <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> from <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and left him alone, and then came the voice out of that cloud, where <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were with God, giving their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to what it ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him. Him,</hi> I ſay, <hi>Non Moſen jam &amp; Eliam</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Thus I have briefly explained the <hi>ſecond</hi> Teſtimony which God the Father gave him, in the audience of three of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples; who had a viſion alſo, at the ſame time, of the glory wherein he was to ſhine, after his departure out of this world. To which teſtimony, our Saviour would not have thoſe Diſciples, as yet to add theirs: but to keep this as a ſecret till he was <hi>riſen again from the dead,</hi> xvii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. It was fit for the <hi>Father</hi> alone to ſpeak <hi>now,</hi> from whom they were to learn what <hi>Jeſus</hi> was: that being fully ſatisfied <hi>they</hi> might be the better able to ſpeak of him <hi>then,</hi> upon their own knowledge; who had been eye and ear-witneſſes of the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory which he received from God the Father, when there came ſuch a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed. And this voice</hi> (S. <hi>Peter</hi> I told you openly avers, 2 i. 17, 18.) <hi>he and others heard, when they were with him in the holy mount.</hi>

                        <p>For this <hi>Third</hi> voice which the Father was pleaſed to ſend from Heaven, to bear witneſs to him, was not heard by ſo few as two or three, but by a great multitude of people; which makes our belief of this Truth to rely ſtill upon ſurer grounds. For you read in the xii. <hi>John</hi> 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that a great company of people having heard what a miracle our Saviour had wrought upon <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom he raiſed from the dead a little before at a neighbouring town; flockt out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to meet him, as he was coming thither to the ſeaſt of the Paſſeover. And being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he was <hi>that King of Iſrael</hi>
                           <pb n="57" facs="tcp:204181:41"/>whom the Lord by his Prophets had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſend in his name, they met him with Palms of joy and triumph in their hands, and with the loudeſt acclamations of praiſe in their mouths; ſpreading their garments alſo in the way (as other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts tell us) to do him the greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and wiſhing him all proſperity in his new Kingdom. In this croud, or among the reſt of the people who were come to worſhip at the feaſt, there were <hi>certain Greeks,</hi> as you read <hi>ver.</hi> 20. who were deſirous <hi>to ſee Jeſus,</hi> whom the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude thus magnified; and, it is likely, wiſh'd to have ſome proof given them, that he was ſuch a perſon as fame reported him.</p>
                        <p>Now the firſt thing our Saviour anſwers to thoſe who preſented them to him (which muſt be diligently noted) is that ere long He <hi>ſhould be glorified.</hi> But firſt he muſt take the Croſs in his way, and then the glory he ſhould attain thereby would be exceeding great; for his death would produce moſt precious fruit, and be the means of enlarging his Kingdom, and bringing innumerable ſuch Gentiles as theſe were, unto God, <hi>ver.</hi> 23, 24. And thereupon He perſwades his Diſciples
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:204181:42"/>(<hi>ver.</hi> 25, 26.) to adventure their lives, according to his example, for the good of mankind; which would redound alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much to their own honour. As they might ſee already in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> (who appeared, S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> thinks, for this end among others, to ſtrengthen and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their Chriſtian reſolution in their ſufferings

A difficult work indeed it was, at the thoughts of which He himſelf could not but be ſomething ſad (<hi>ver.</hi> 27.) and wiſht, according to the inclinations of Nature, there were ſome other way, if God pleaſed, to deliver mankind. But ſince he had ſent him into the world for this end, that he ſhould lay down his life for our Redemption, he reſolves preſently to ſubmit to God, and deſires only this one thing of him, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>Father, glorifie thy Name.</hi> As much as to ſay, I know thou art my <hi>FATHER,</hi> and ſince it is thy pleaſure, to which I will always ſubmit; behold, I offer my ſelf now to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of thy glory by my paſſion, as I have been hitherto by my preaching, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:204181:42"/>the works thou haſt done by my hands. I am content to receive the glory which I expect, and juſt now told my Diſciples I ſhall receive, in this way of humble ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy will and pleaſure. I am deſirous <hi>thou</hi> ſhouldeſt firſt be glorified; and if my death will ſerve that end, I am ready to part with my life, for I know thou wilt be much more glorified by my Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Aſcenſion to Heaven. There is no reaſonable doubt to be made of the truth of this interpretation; for they <hi>glorifie God</hi> moſt remarkably who die for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Truth, xxi. <hi>John</hi> 19. It is a great honour to him, that they love him more than their lives, and will take his word for their recompenſe, in an inviſible world. This our Saviour himſelf calls, <hi>Gods being glorified in him,</hi> xiii. <hi>John</hi> 31. and therefore I make no queſtion he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires here, that his Fathers Name may be glorified by the ſame means.</p>
                        <p>Now to this humble requeſt of his, God the Father replies, by a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying, <hi>I have both glorified it, and will glorifie it again.</hi> You remember what S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays in the place often cited alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, 2 i. 17. that our Lord by the former voice from Heaven, <hi>received honour and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:204181:43"/>glory from God the Father;</hi> and there is as much cauſe to think that in this there was the ſame deſign, to do him honour by a declaration of the glory he ſhould ſhortly receive, at the right hand of God. The very connexion of theſe words with the foregoing, will not let us expound them otherwiſe. For having told his Diſciples, the <hi>Son of man ſhould ſhortly be glorified,</hi> but firſt he muſt <hi>glorifie God</hi> by his paſſion, and then he doubted not but <hi>God would glorifie him with himſelf</hi> (as he ſpeaks, xiii. 32.) that is, by the very ſame means, glorifie both himſelf and his Son, who had glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him: Yes, ſays God himſelf from Heaven, <hi>I have both glorified my Name</hi> (by what he had done for <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and by him) <hi>and will glorifie it again,</hi> by that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtill to be done.</p>
                        <p>And indeed (1.) it did him a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that God was pleaſed to return any anſwer to him, who had before called himſelf <hi>his Son</hi> (x. 36.) and had juſt now addreſſed himſelf to him as his Father; calling upon him twice by this Name, <hi>Father, ſave me from this hour,</hi> ver. 27. <hi>Father, glorifie thy Name,</hi> ver. 28. It was as much as to ſay, He owned the relation, allowed his pretences, and intended to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:204181:43"/>juſtifie them more and more by his Divine approbation. For (2.) the Anſwer it ſelf is a plain promiſe of the honour he would confer upon him hereafter, by his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Exaltation; when he <hi>again glorified himſelf,</hi> by glorifying the Lord <hi>Jeſas.</hi> You read expreſly in the foregoing Chapter, that the Glory he had gotten <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> was by glorifying of his Son; for he ſays (xi. 4.) the ſickneſs of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was <hi>for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</hi> And therefore when he ſays he will glorifie himſelf <hi>again,</hi> the meaning is, that as they had <hi>ſeen his glory</hi> (xi. 40.) in the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, and in all the other mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous works which <hi>Jeſus</hi> had done, for which the people gave him glory (v. <hi>Luke</hi> 26. vii. 16. xix. 37.) So he would glorifie himſelf more by the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf from the dead, and by his Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an Heavenly Kingdom. For it was the <hi>working of the might of his power</hi> (as the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, i. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 19.) which he <hi>wrought in Chriſt, when the Father of glory raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:204181:44"/>in that which is to come.</hi> Now he <hi>glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Son Jeſus</hi> indeed, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, iii. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>and gave him a name which is above every name,</hi> that every knee ſhould bow to him, and every tongue confeſs him to be the Lord: but it was <hi>to the glory of God the Father,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us expreſly, ii. <hi>Philip.</hi> 11. Hereby he <hi>glorified his own name,</hi> as by this voice from Heaven he ſaid he would; whoſe power, goodneſs, and wiſdom, will be for ever magnified and celebrated with the higheſt praiſes, by the whole Chriſtian Church, for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch a glorious Prince over them, who is not <hi>aſhamed to call them Brethren,</hi> and yet hath <hi>all things put in ſubjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet;</hi> that he may protect, ſuccour and bleſs them, here and eternally.</p>
                        <p>Now by making this promiſe to the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> of glorifying himſelf by glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying him, in this manner; He plainly bare witneſs to him, that he was what he pretended to be; very dear to him, his only begotten Son, and no deceiver, as they falſely and blaſphemouſly ſaid, who were loth to be governed by him. They ought preſently to have glorified God, by honouring his Son, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for their Lord and Maſter: who
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:204181:44"/>had ſuch power with God already, that he would give him whatſoever he askt (xi. <hi>John</hi> 22.) and was ſhortly to receive greater, even all power in Heaven and in Earth, xvii. 1, 2.</p>
                        <p>For this voice, you may obſerve, was uttered at ſuch a time, and ſo loud, that the people who ſtood by heard it, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. Thoſe who were at ſome diſtance indeed, hearing only the ſound, thought it had been a clap of thunder: but they who were nearer, heard it ſo diſtinctly, that they were of opinion, <hi>an Angel ſpake to him.</hi> God, that is, by the Miniſtry of an Angel. For what is ſaid in one place of Scripture to be done by Angels, who are his principal ſervants, is in another ſaid to be done by God. As <hi>the Angel of the Lord</hi> we read, vii. <hi>Acts</hi> 30. <hi>appeared to Moſes in the buſh,</hi> and in the next verſe, it is the <hi>voice of the Lord</hi> which from thence is ſaid to come to him. In like manner the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> is ſaid (<hi>ver.</hi> 38.) to <hi>ſpeak with him in mount Sinai;</hi> where, we are told in the book of <hi>Exodus</hi> xix. 20. the <hi>Lord came down and called Moſes up to the top of the Mount,</hi> and there ſpake to him; as here he did to our Saviour. Who tells the people it was not for his ſake, that God
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:204181:45"/>ſpake now to him; it was for theirs; whom he would have to know that when he was <hi>lifted up from the Earth</hi> (by hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Croſs, which was a ſtep, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all mens opinion, to his Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Heavens) <hi>he would draw all men to him:</hi> bring even the Gentile world into ſubjection to him, and bow their hearts to acknowledge his Divine authority, which the <hi>Jews</hi> oppoſed. He needed no further confirmation of this truth himſelf, who knew how dear he was to God, and that he would <hi>glorifie his Name</hi> in him; but that his Diſciples might be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of it, and the people more inclined to believe it when they heard it preached, God ſpake the very ſame now in the ears of a great many, which he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to him and a few beſides in the former voices from Heaven.</p>
                        <p>It is true indeed, He is not called here <hi>Gods beloved Son,</hi> in expreſs terms, as he is in the other places. But this is ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed, and ſtrongly inferr'd, as I ſaid, from the voice which now ſpake, that it puts the matter out of doubt, as much as the former. If he had falſely and proudly laid claim to this high relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, whom he calls his Father, we
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:204181:45"/>may be confident God would never have honoured him with ſuch an anſwer; but either have been ſilent, or ſaid the quite contrary: telling him, before all the company, that he would not glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by preferring, but by putting to ſhame ſuch an one as he, who thus arrogantly took upon him to be the Son of God. It is contrary to all reaſon to think that God would ſtoop to <hi>ſeek the glory</hi> of any perſon (as our Saviour expreſſes the honour he had done him, viii. <hi>John</hi> 50.) but one who ſtood ſo nearly related to him, as to be his Son: and therefore worthy to be glorified by him again and again, until He had fully <hi>judged,</hi> as he there ſpeaks, between Him and his Adverſaries; who denied him to be the Chriſt, but was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by God to be the Prince of life.</p>
                        <p>To conclude this, you may note that not long before God ſpake in this manner from Heaven to them, our Saviour had ſaid, That they <hi>had not heard his voice</hi> at any time, v. <hi>John</hi> 37. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt had, and ſo had three of his Diſciples. And therefore <hi>John</hi> bare witneſs of him; <hi>whoſe teſtimony,</hi> he ſays, <hi>was true (ver.</hi> 32.) though he did not ſtand in ſuch need of it, as if his credit could not be ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:204181:46"/>without it. No, He appealed to him, merely becauſe they had ſuch an high opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him, <hi>ver.</hi> 33, 34. otherwiſe he <hi>had a greater teſtimony than that of John (ver.</hi> 36.) which was not only the <hi>works that he did, which teſtified of him, that the Father had ſent him:</hi> but <hi>the Father himſelf who ſent him</hi> (note this, for he appeals now to what the voice from Heaven ſaid) <hi>he has born witneſs of him, ver.</hi> 37. And if they had had any goodneſs in them (<hi>ver.</hi> 38.) they would have received him <hi>whom the Father ſent.</hi> When did He ſend him, but when he ſpake by that voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? which now he utters once more in other words, for their greater and fuller ſatisfaction, when many of them were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together; that they, who had not hitherto, might hear his voice as well as <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf and his Apoſtles; and be awakened hereby to attend to what the other witneſſes of him ſhould ſay, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after he was riſen from the dead.</p>
                        <p>I ſhould paſs now to the Examination of one of them, were it not fit, before I part with this, to take notice of a Tradition which runs among the <hi>Jews,</hi> concerning this way of Revelation <hi>by a voice</hi> from Heaven; which they ſay was very uſual
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:204181:46"/>in thoſe ages. <hi>The Doctors deliver</hi> (ſo their words are in the <hi>Babylonian Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud
<note n="*" place="margin">In the title <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim, cap.</hi> 1.</note>) that from the death of the latter Prophets, Haggai, Zachariah and Malachy, the Holy Ghoſt was taken away: but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they had the Miniſtry of the Bath Col, i. e.</hi> the daughter of a voice. By that name they call this way of Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe they ſay it was not a full and ſtrong voice which they heard, but a voice coming out of another voice, and heard when it was gone. Juſt as ſparks, ſay they, are called <hi>Bene reſheph,</hi> the ſons of an hot coal, becauſe they leap out of the fire; ſo is this called the <hi>daughter of a voice,</hi> becauſe it reſulted from a voice, and came, as it were, out of the womb of it: being a kind of Eccho after ſomething that was ſpoken, which they could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; but only caught hold of this tail, as I may call it, and concluſion of it. And they would have us believe, that as under the firſt Temple they had the benefit of <hi>Prophecy, Urim and Thummim,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> ſo this ſucceeded them under the ſecond Temple, and was proper to that age of the world: being then only in uſe, when all the other were wanting. Hence many Chriſtian writers of theſe latter times, have fancied that God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:204181:47"/>declared <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be his Son by a voice from Heaven, becauſe it was the only way wherein he then communicated his mind to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation. <hi>Paulus Fagius</hi> think was the firſt that ſtarted this notion of the <hi>Bath col:</hi> which was <hi>a praeludium b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But that there was any ſuch thing under the ſecond Temple, I ſee no ground at all to believe. It is far more probable that they have deviſed a number of ſuch ſtories as we read in their Books, merely to gain ſome credit and reputation to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. Can any man of ſence imagine that God would bid <hi>Jonathan</hi> hold his hand when he was beginning to Paraphraſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prophets; ſaying to him by a voice from Heaven, <hi>Who is this that reveals my ſecrets to the ſons of men?</hi> And that he, like a bold fellow, ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>I am the man, who undertake it for thy honour, and not my own?</hi> And yet <hi>Elias Levita</hi> has the confidence to tell us, in his Preface to theſe Paraphraſes, that as <hi>Jonathan</hi> was going to do as much for the <hi>Holy writings</hi> (as they call them) as he had done for the <hi>Prophets,</hi> he was abſolutely prohibited by another voice from Heaven, which ſaid, <hi>Is it not ſufficient that thou haſt divulged the myſteries of the Prophets, but thou wilt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute alſo the ſecrets of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> So the good man deſiſted, and durſt not do the Angels any further ſervice; who came to liſten to him as he was expounding
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:204181:48"/>the Prophets. Which is as true, I make no doubt, as all the reſt: and we may as well believe the <hi>Earth quaked for forty mile together,</hi> when he began his Paraphraſe, and that if a fly did but ſit upon his Book in which he wrote, <hi>fire came down from Heaven</hi> and deſtroyed it, leaving the Book untoucht, as believe a ſyllable of theſe voices ſpeaking from Heaven to him, for they have all the very ſame Authors. Who having got this by the end, know not when to have done with it; but tell us for the honour of <hi>R.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:204181:49"/>from Heaven as the wiſe men ſat in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Jericho,</hi> ſaying, <hi>There is one here who is worthy that the Divine majeſty or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> (by which they mean ſometime the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt) ſhould reſt upon him, as it did on Moſes; but the age wherein he lives is not worthy of that favour.</hi> Whereupon they all caſt their eyes on <hi>Hillel</hi> a famous man among them. And of another voice as they were ſitting together at <hi>Jafne,</hi> which ſaid the very ſame words again; and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their eyes towards <hi>R. Samuel</hi> the leſs. And, to name but one more, <hi>R. Juda</hi> the <hi>Holy</hi> Doctor, they would have it believed, was aſſured by this voice from Heaven, that his Prayer was heard, juſt as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours was in the place I have before open'd. For when he was dying (and it was not many days before our Saviour's death, that he prayed in thoſe words, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, glorifie thy name) he lift up his ten fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and ſaid, Lord of the world, it is known to thee that I have laboured in the Law with my ten fingers, and have not received the leaſt advantage thereby, no not in my little finger. May it pleaſe thee, that I may have peace in my reſt.</hi> And then out came the <hi>Bath col</hi> ſaying thoſe words of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lvii. 2. <hi>He ſhall enter into peace: they ſhall reſt in their beds.</hi> Which, together with all
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:204181:49"/>other of the ſame kind, deſerve to be put under no other <hi>Title,</hi> than that of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Fables</hi> (mentioned by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> i. <hi>Tit.</hi> 14.) or <hi>old-Wives tales</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 7.) wherewith little children are wont to be entertained: being invented, it is likely, in imitation of the Goſpel ſtory, to adorn and ſupport the ruinous doctrine of their Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, and to bring it into ſome eſteem with their ſottiſh poſterity.</p>
                        <p>But we may as well believe the idle tale which the factious <hi>Donatiſts</hi> told concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Father of their Sect;

                           <hi>to whom God gave an anſwer from Heaven,</hi> they ſaid, as he was praying to him: as give ear to this Fable of <hi>R. Judah,</hi> who muſt be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by them becauſe he was the compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of their traditional Law. And as for <hi>R. Samuel</hi> the leſs, whom I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he was the man who compoſed the famous Prayer againſt Hereticks for their publick Devotions; wherein they deſire God that he would <hi>deſtroy all Hereticks:</hi> whereby they mean Chriſtians, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in thoſe days to grow apace. And therefore it is no wonder that he is cried up to the skies, and muſt be honoured with praiſes from Heaven. But the beſt of it is, theſe petty ſtories want vouchers; or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:204181:50"/>thoſe who offer themſelves had need to bring ſome better men to be bound for their honeſty. They have no <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts to atteſt any thing, much leſs ſuch men as the Apoſtles, who with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Miracles and Prophecy, were ready on all occaſions to pawn their lives, that they did not <hi>follow cunningly deviſed Fables,</hi> when <hi>they made known the power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord Jeſus, but were eye-witneſſes,</hi> as you have heard, <hi>of his Majeſty, and heard the voice when they were with him in the holy Mount, which ſaid, This is my well beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Maſters</hi> in <hi>Iſrael</hi> alſo are not ſo <hi>cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> in their contrivances, nor ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their craft, but they forget the old Rule which admoniſhes <hi>a Lyar to have a good memory.</hi> For they contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, while they tell us this <hi>Bath col</hi> was but the fag end of a voice, a kind of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho leaping out of another voice; and yet make it deliver ſuch long ſentences. And what likelihood is there that God ſhould grace ſuch men as they, who had turned their Religion into vain janglings and idle diſputes (witneſs the quarrel between the School of that <hi>Hillel</hi> now mentioned, and the Schoolof <hi>Schammai</hi>) with ſuch <hi>Elogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> from Heaven, as were fit to be given
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:204181:50"/>only to the beſt of men, yea, to the Son of God himſelf?</p>
                        <p>One of theſe <hi>four</hi> things is far more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. Either that their latter writers have ſtrained the words of their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too far, who meant perhaps no more by their hearing a <hi>Bath col,</hi> but that the thing whereof they write, was as evident to them, as if they had had a Divine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for it. For in <hi>Pirke Avoth</hi> I obſerve <hi>R. Joſhuah</hi> ſays, that <hi>jotzeth Bath col, the daughter of a voice goeth forth day by day from mount Horeb, and proclaims, ſaying, Wo to men becauſe of their contempt of the Law.</hi> Which can ſignifie no more, but that if men would liſten to the Law which God gave there, they would hear how dangerous it is to diſobey it. Or, <hi>ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> there was ſomething of a conjuration in it. For in <hi>Pirke Elieſer</hi> I find
<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</note>, that when there was a diſpute only about the Leap-year, the Governour of the School pronounced the Name with four Letters, and preſently they heard a voice, ſaying, <hi>The Lord ſpake to Moſes and Aaron,</hi> &amp;c. As if they could have this voice, whenſoever they did but pronounce that ſingle word. Or, <hi>thirdly,</hi> they were men of a ſtrong imagination, which made
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:204181:51"/>them fancy they heard a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when it was only a blaſt of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly fumes and vapours whiſtling in their brain. For this may be a fair account of thoſe, who thought, as ſome among us have done, that they heard ſuch or ſuch a place of Scripture ſounding in their ears, as an anſwer to their prayers or their doubts. Or, <hi>laſtly,</hi> there being many <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviours time and afterward, who knew very well what had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him, but yet continued ſworn enemies to his Religion; they ventured to report the ſame of their own Doctors, and perſwaded the people that they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by voices from Heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be received by all poſterity as men of a Divine ſtamp, who had the higheſt teſtimony from Almighty God.</p>
                        <p>This I am ſure of, there is nothing to make it credible that any man among them in thoſe Ages was thus honoured by God. No body appears that dare ſay they heard it. Nor does any of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they ſaw theſe <hi>Rabbies</hi> ſhine in the leaſt glimpſe of ſuch glory as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did, when he was honoured with that glorious teſtimony from Heaven, which pronounced him the Head of all principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:204181:51"/>and power. Much leſs were they, as S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks, by <hi>many infallible proofs</hi> (for we rely not upon the voice from Heaven by it ſelf alone) declared to be the men of God. And therefore, that which to me ſeems neareſt to the truth in this matter is, that there had been a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, deep ſilence ſince the death of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Prophets, and no Revelation made of Gods mind, of any ſort whatſoever, in that Nation, till <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt came, who was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and ſent by God in the ſpirit and power of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> to prepare the way of our Lord. Who when he firſt appeared had ſuch an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation given him by God the Father, in the audience of <hi>John,</hi> as had not been vouchſafed to any perſon; and in ſuch a manner (by a voice from Heaven) as had not been in uſe for many ages; but yet was the moſt ancient way of his communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his mind to men. Thus God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>Adam</hi> in the Garden, and thus he ſpake to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi> and therefore ſo he now ſpeaks to him who was the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> the true <hi>ſeed</hi> promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Prophet like to <hi>Moſes:</hi> Teſtifying both to him and to others by his own voice from Heaven (which was the old way of Revelation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:204181:52"/>all others, and a clearer way there cannot be) that he was his only begotten Son.</p>
                        <p>And here perhaps it may not be amiſs to obſerve, that this voice anciently was very low, like a ſmall whiſper in ones ear: whereas the voice to our Saviour was loud and ſtrong, making a great noiſe in the ears of thoſe that heard it. So <hi>Eliphaz</hi> tells us, iv. <hi>Job</hi> 16. that in a viſion which he had, <hi>There was ſilence, and I heard a voice.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> is exactly rendred by <hi>Mercer, I heard ſilence and a voice;</hi> that is, a ſtill voice, as the Margin of our Bible hath it. And ſo <hi>Elias</hi> is ſaid to hear a <hi>voice of ſilence,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xix. 12. <hi>a still ſmall voice,</hi> as we render it; a ſpeech next to ſilence, which did but whiſper very low, and made no noiſe at all in his ears. On the contrary you read in the place laſt expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (xii. <hi>John</hi>) the voice which ſpake of our Saviour was ſo loud and audible, that the people, who were at ſome diſtance, thought it had been a clap of thunder. It did not ſilently creep into their ears, but rent the clouds to make its way with a great deal of power and force into them. I cannot ſay that the other voice was ſo loud, which the Diſciples heard on the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:204181:52"/>
                           <hi>holy Mount,</hi> but it was ſo clear and piercing, that when they heard it (xvii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.) they were aſtoniſhed, and fell flat upon their faces. The light wherein he appeared was not more viſible than the voice which teſtified to him was audible; and both were very amazing. Which may very well denote the excellency of our Saviours perſon, and the efficacy of his doctrine, above all that had been before him. He declared Gods mind more fully and perfectly, and ſpake it more plainly and perſpicuouſly. He tranſcended all others in both theſe, as much as a full voice is above a little murmur or whiſper in the ear; or a ſpeech diſtinctly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, is to be preferred before the liſping of imperfect words.</p>
                        <p>But whatſoever become of this, we may certainly conclude from the audibleneſs and clearneſs of the voice, whereby God gave his teſtimony to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that they are the more to be believed, who affirm they heard this voice from Heaven and report it to us; it not being eaſie for them to be deceived. This voice was like that of an Herald who proclaims a Prince; and it ſaid, in effect, <hi>I have ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion, Thou art my Son, this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:204181:53"/>day have I begotten thee.</hi> Which had a moſt eminent and full completion at his Reſurrection and Exaltation; but began to be fulfilled when he was tranfigured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>holy hill,</hi> and had a repreſentation of his future glory made to him. Which he did not aſſume to himſelf, as the Apoſtle diſcourſes, v. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4, 5. but was called unto it by him that ſaid <hi>then, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee;</hi> and ſaid <hi>now, This is my well beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus you ſee, having made an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the Teſtimony of one of theſe <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> and greateſt, we find it ſo full and clear on his behalf, that we muſt either disbelieve God, or elſe believe in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and receive him for the Son of God. For he received more than once <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory</hi> from God the Father. Who was ſo highly <hi>glorified alſo by Him,</hi> that he hath now completely <hi>glorified him with himſelf,</hi> and therefore expects that his Name ſhould be perpetually glorified and praiſed by us, in ſome ſuch words as theſe.</p>

Our heart ought to anſwer thee again, with the voice of joy, thankſgiving and praiſe. Thy high praiſes ought to be in all our mouths. It becomes us to ſay continually, with the moſt elevated minds and hearts, Glory be to thee, O Lord; Glory be to thee, O Lord: who dwelleſt on high, and yet humbleſt thy ſelf to behold the things that are in Heaven and in Earth.

                     <p>IT is time now to proceed to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the next Witneſs, which is the WORD, and to weigh the evidence which He gives concerning <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> that is, concerning him who was born of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by that Name; who ſaid, He was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> I make no doubt but we ſhall find his teſtimony as full and as ſtrong as the former to verifie this; when we have in a few words (according to my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded brevity) declared, who this WORD is, who now comes and deſires to be heard as a Witneſs for <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And we are told by this very Apoſtle in the firſt Verſe of his Goſpel, that the WORD is a Divine being, which had

For he was then <hi>with God,</hi> the World was made by him, and therefore <hi>He was God.</hi> That is, God of God the Father; to whom <q>he hath ſuch a relation (to ſpeak in the words of S. <hi>Greg.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:204181:56"/>the whole perſon <hi>God-man</hi> is called the WORD, as you read in the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of this Epiſtle of S. <hi>John.</hi> Where the WORD is deſcribed to be ſuch a perſon as may be <hi>ſeen,</hi> and <hi>felt,</hi> and <hi>handled,</hi> as well as <hi>heard.</hi> And He is very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called by this Name, becauſe it is his office to declare the mind and will of God to men (as we by our ſpeech declare ours one to another) which otherways we could not know. <hi>For no man hath ſeen God at any time</hi> (i. John 18.) <hi>the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In theſe words we have a plain and full account, why our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> is called the WORD of God. Not merely becauſe he hath revealed to us the Counſel and the pleaſure of God, for ſo did the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the holy Apoſtles: but <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe he was the <hi>immediate Interpreter</hi> of the Divine mind and will, as the word which we ſpeak is of ours. For he was in the very <hi>boſom of the Father;</hi> that is, knew his mind not by the inſtructions of an Angel, not by Viſions or Dreams, nor only by the Holy Ghoſt; but by a more intimate diſcovery of Gods counſels and purpoſes to him, as a perſon that was one
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:204181:57"/>with him. We cannot underſtand leſs by his being in his Fathers boſom: which is a phraſe that ſignifies He had the neareſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with Him, and was privy to his moſt ſecret counſels. Which He was able alſo to accompliſh and bring to paſs, and for that reaſon (which is the <hi>ſecond</hi>) may be called the WORD of God. Becauſe he hath ſuch a power in Heaven and Earth, that at his word or command all things are preſently done according to his will. For <hi>Jeſus</hi> being repreſented, you may obſerve, in a viſion to S. <hi>John,</hi> as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, clothed in a purple, <hi>i.e.</hi> a royal robe; is called by the name of the <hi>Word of God;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">xix. Rev. 13</note> after he had done pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing God's mind and will, and was then only executing ſome of his Decrees, by that power which he hath at God's right hand. A power ſo great, that he can by his Word alone (as the Scripture ſpeaks in other caſes of God Almighty, xxxiii. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 6.) without any viſible means to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, compaſs his ends, and fulfil what he hath ſpoken either in his threats or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> the Article before this Name, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the WORD,</hi> denotes Him to be the perſon to whom this Title ſo particularly and eminently belongs, that it can be given to none elſe. Becauſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:204181:57"/>he hath moſt perfectly declared God's mind and will to us, and revealed to us all his ſecret purpoſes concerning us in the fulleſt manner that can be; and hath a power far ſurmounting all creatures, to do every thing as he hath declared.</p>

No, we are to conſider that the Apoſtle is now ſpeaking of thoſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> which are <hi>in Heaven,</hi> and thence give their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: And therefore we muſt not, at preſent, ſeek for any evidences which He produced, while he was on Earth, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie his high Authority, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the Name of the <hi>Son of God;</hi> but enquire after thoſe only, which He hath given of it, ſince He went to Heaven, and aſcended to the Throne of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:204181:58"/>his glory. From whence this <hi>Word of God</hi> hath been pleaſed to ſpeak, or in ſome very remarkable manner to aſſert this Truth, upon no leſs than <hi>three</hi> ſeveral oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>

                           <hi>Firſt</hi> of all He ſhowed himſelf to his firſt Martyr S. <hi>Steven,</hi> in a ſenſible Majeſty; <hi>standing at the right hand of God,</hi> in the ſplendor of the Divine glory. Read but the vii. <hi>Acts</hi> 55, 56. and there you will find He made himſelf ſo plainly appear to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and that <hi>with power</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> you have heard ſpeaks in 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.) that is, the King of Heaven and Earth, next to the moſt ſupreme Majeſty of God the Father Almighty) that nothing can be ſaid againſt it; unleſs any man will be ſo audacious as to fancy that this holy and glorious Martyr was ſtrongly deluded. But there is a clear demonſtration againſt that, from the whole ſtory of his Life and Death. For He was a man of great note and eminency in the Church; who held the very firſt place among the ſeven Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons (vi. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.) that were choſen to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the daily miniſtration to the poor. The feeding of whoſe bodies He did not
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:204181:58"/>think the only thing belonging to his charge; but ſuch was his zeal, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe broke and diſpenſed the Bread of life to all his neighbours. He juſtified the Chriſtian Faith (of which he was full, vi. <hi>Acts</hi> 5, 8, 10.) againſt all oppoſers; with ſingular wiſdom, great fervour and mighty demonſtrations, by the power of the holy Ghoſt. He confounded all thoſe whom he diſputed withall, though he could not overcome them. He ſtopt their mouths by the <hi>wiſdom and ſpirit</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſpake: which made them wiſh they could ſtop his, though there was no other way, they ſaw, to ſilence him, but by taking away his life. They ſuborned therefore falſe witneſſes againſt <hi>him,</hi> whom they knew not how to confute. They brought him before their Great Council to be tried. Where all his Judges fixing their eyes upon him, ſaw he was ſo far from being at all daunted, that there was a ſparkling Majeſty in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, like that of an Angel when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to their forefathers, vi. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. They could never deviſe or fancy any thing greater to ſay of them or of their moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Doctors, than now they beheld in this illuſtrious perſon. The face of the Patriarch <hi>Iſaac,</hi> they tell us, was ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:204181:59"/>when the holy Spirit reſted on him, that a Divine light or ſplendor came from his face. And they would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Phineas</hi> his countenance did burn and flame like a Torch, by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of the holy Ghoſt in him. Nay, <hi>Maimonides</hi> himſelf (to omit the other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in which I find theſe reports) will have the Prophets to be Angels. So he interprets more than once, the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>fourth</hi> verſes of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Chapter of the Book of <hi>Judges.</hi> Where by the <hi>Angel of the Lord</hi> he underſtands a Prophet whom God ſent to them, to bring them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And expreſly ſays

                              <hi>More Nevoch. part</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 42.</note> that their wiſe men have told them, <hi>This was Phineas; for at that time when the Majeſty of God dwelt upon him, He was like to an Angel of the Lord.</hi> And it is the opinion of ſome of them, whoſe Names are not worth mentioning, that in the Prophetical viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the form of a man vaniſhed, and the appearance of an Angel came in the room thereof, till ſuch time as the Viſion ceaſed. The light which ſhone within was ſo great, that it broke through their bodies, and externally appeared; if we could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe Doctors, who would fain adorn their wiſe men with that glory, which they really beheld in this man of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:204181:59"/>God S. <hi>Steven.</hi> Who was ſo full of the holy Ghoſt, and had ſuch glorious illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in his mind, that there was indeed an amazing luſtre in his face, and he lookt more like an Angel than a man. This emboldened him to ſpeak to that grave Senate with all the aſſurance in the world; and to reprove them for reſiſting the holy Ghoſt. Which ſo cut them to the heart, that it enraged them to the higheſt degree of fury, and they lookt upon him as if they would eat him up. But he, ſtill full of the holy Ghoſt, and nothing fearing what he ſaw he muſt ſuffer from an exaſperated multitude, caſt up his eyes above, and faſtned them ſtedfaſtly upon the Heavens, from whence cometh our help. Where He bade them all take notice (vii. <hi>Acts</hi> 54, 55, 56.) that he <hi>ſaw the glory of God</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhining at his right hand in a far greater glory than they had ſeen in his face. That was only a glimpſe of the Majeſty of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom he preached to them; and now feared not to affirm that he ſaw in his royal ſplendour and greatneſs, incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly above all the Angels in Heaven.</p>
                        <p>And is it not a great deal more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to believe that He indeed ſaw <hi>Jeſus</hi> there, than to think that he would obtrude
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:204181:60"/>thus boldly a mere imagination upon them, with the certain loſs of his own life? If he had not been ſure that he beheld him whom they crucified, now moſt highly glorified, a perſon of his wiſdom and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would have been more cautious than to follow him in that bloudy path, to which this aſſertion led him; when, if he would have held his tongue, there lay a fairer and ſmoother way before him. But ſo viſible was the royal Majeſty of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that he could not but proclaim it aloud, and <hi>ſpeak,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>the things which he had ſeen:</hi> though he knew they would call it blaſphemy, and puniſh him for it with preſent death. He was willing to ſuffer that, for the honour of his Maſter, and to teſtifie his love to him: who told him his Faith was no fancy, as he might ſee by the glory wherein he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. Which abundantly ſatisfied him that he was the Son of the Higheſt; able to reward all his faithful ſervants with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal glory. It is true, we read of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a word that our Lord ſpake to this Saint; but the ſplendour of his appearance in ſuch glory and Majeſty at God's right hand, was as ſignificant as any words could be: and bid him be aſſured of the truth of what S. <hi>John</hi> is here proving, that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:204181:60"/>indeed he is the Chriſt, the anointed of God; anointed with the oil of gladneſs above all his fellows; made the Lord of all things; inferior to none but only him who hath put all things in ſubjection under his feet.</p>
                        <p>If any one ask me how he could <hi>ſee the glory of God,</hi> and how he knew this to be <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who appeared at <hi>Gods right hand?</hi> I Anſwer to the firſt enquiry, that He ſaw God's glory in the ſame ſence that others are ſaid to have ſeen God: who beheld ſome very bright appearance, an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary light ſhining before their eyes, which excelled all that ever they had ſeen or could imagine, and was the token of the Divine preſence. Thus <hi>Moſes was afraid to look upon God,</hi> iii. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are ſaid to <hi>ſee the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> xxiv. 20. which places <hi>Maimonides</hi> thinks are to be underſtood of the Viſion of God, with the eyes of the mind. But the Text is plainly againſt him, which tells us there was a viſible appearance of ſome unuſual, aſtoniſhing brightneſs. And therefore he confeſſes that if any man do conceive thoſe words are to be interpreted of ſome created light (as he ſpeaks

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:204181:61"/>or of an Angel, there is no danger in ſuch an apprehenſion. And indeed no man can ſeriouſly read the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but he will ſee plainly they ſpeak of a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible glory, which was exceeding dazling, and ſometimes too great for the weak eyes of men to behold.

                              <pb n="97" facs="tcp:204181:61"/>glory of the Sun, another glory of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars; for one Star differeth from another Star in glory:</hi> that is, in the brightneſs and ſplendour of its light.</p>
                        <p>Such a glory it was that now S. <hi>Steven</hi> beheld, but far more ſplendid, more pure and illuſtrious, than the light of the Sun or any other that has been mentioned; which was a repreſentation of the preſence of the Divine Majeſty, who uſed in this manner to make men ſenſible of his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent inviſible glory. And there, in the Divine preſence he ſaw our Lord, in the moſt high and honourable place, next to God the Father himſelf. For that's the meaning of his appearing at <hi>the right hand of God,</hi> or of that great <hi>glory</hi> he ſaw in the Heavens: the right hand being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal place belonging to the Heir of the Crown, when he appears together with the King his Father. And therefore the Divine writer to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſays, there never was any Angel ſeen there. They only <hi>stand</hi> or miniſter <hi>before God</hi> or before his Throne; <hi>but to which of them did he ſay at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy foot-stool?</hi> i. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. This is the prerogative of Chriſt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:204181:62"/>alone, the great King, the Heir of all things; whoſe glory the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes in that place (cx. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.) from whence theſe words are cited; that is, prophecies of his Kingly power in the Heavens, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> clearly expounds this phraſe of <hi>ſitting at Gods right hand,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 25. <hi>For he muſt reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</hi> He is a King, and he reigns, and he hath a Throne (i. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.) but when he is compared with God the Father Almighty, the fountain of all power and authority, and when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears together with him; to ſhow that he reigns under him and for him, he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as ſitting at the <hi>right hand of God,</hi> or the right hand of the <hi>Throne of God.</hi> For ſo his Kingly power is expreſſed in other places, <hi>He is ſet down on the right hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in the Heavens, Hebr.</hi> viii. 1. xii. 2. that is, He reigns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with God the Father in the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial glory. For the <hi>throne of God</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Scripture phraſe (as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Maimonides</hi> obſerves) that place where God's Majeſty manifeſts it ſelf in a viſible ſplendour and glory: the ſitting of our Saviour at the right hand of that Throne, or that glory denotes nothing elſe, but his being ſeated in the higheſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:204181:62"/>honour that can be given to any one in the Heavenly places: next in greatneſs, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and majeſty to God himſelf, under whom he is the King of Angels, and Men, and all Creatures. There was nothing of which this holy Martyr was more aſſured. To whom this Heavenly King appeared, not in his uſual poſture of <hi>ſitting</hi> at God's right hand, as one poſſeſſed of his royal power; but <hi>standing</hi> there, as if he was miniſtring in the Heavenly Sanctuary, in the quality of a royal high-Prieſt (for that was the poſture of thoſe that miniſtred in the Temple, cxxxiv. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.) for the comfort of all Chriſtian people, and of himſelf eſpecially: or rather as ready to come to take vengeance of thoſe impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable enemies, who had killed him and now perſecuted his ſervants; which was a notable inſtance of his royal power at God's right hand. For there the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays he muſt reign, till he hath ſubdued all thoſe that oppoſe his authority, and troden them under his feet.</p>
                        <p>And, as for the <hi>ſecond</hi> enquiry, how he could know this to be <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom he ſaw in this Heavenly Majeſty? It is eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that He appeared to him with ſuch a countenance as he had here upon
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:204181:63"/>Earth; only more ſhining and bright, as being now in the glory of the Father. And ſo he tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> I ſee <hi>the Son of Man</hi> ſtanding at the right hand of God. That very perſon, he means, who uſed to call himſelf the <hi>Son of man,</hi> whom you crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſhonourably treated, I now ſee ſo exalted, that I had rather die as he did, than not confeſs him to be the <hi>Son of God,</hi> as he ſaid he was when he died.</p>
                        <p>This is the firſt teſtimony which was given to this truth by the WORD. Who bore witneſs in a moſt illuſtrious manner to himſelf, when he appeared thus (to a perſon of the greateſt credit) in the <hi>Divine glory,</hi> and in the <hi>higheſt place</hi> of Celeſtial dignity; (as the <hi>King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> that is) and <hi>riſen up from his Throne;</hi> as if he was coming to be <hi>avenged</hi> of his adverſaries, to <hi>ſuccour</hi> all his ſervants, and to <hi>welcome</hi> this Martyr into glory with himſelf. So S. <hi>Steven</hi> verily thought, for he reſigns up his Soul to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> with the ſame confidence and almoſt in the ſame words, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> gave up his to God the Father. The laſt words of our Saviour were, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit,</hi> xxiii. <hi>Luke</hi> 46. And they ſtoned <hi>Steven,</hi> calling upon God, and ſaying,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:204181:63"/>
                           <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit,</hi> vii. <hi>Acts</hi> 59. He died with theſe and the following de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout words in his mouth, crying again with a loud voice, <hi>Lord, lay not this ſin to their charge.</hi> In which he expreſſed as much <hi>charity</hi> to men, as in the other he did <hi>faith</hi> in Chriſt. And openly declared himſelf a perſon of ſuch piety and goodneſs, ſuch admirable candor and ſweetneſs of ſpirit, ſo utterly void of all rancor and gall, when he had the higheſt provocations from his bitter enemies: that as we may be ſure he could not be guilty of deviſing a lye to the deceiving of others; ſo we may reaſonably believe that God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would not let ſuch an excellent man be deceived, to the ruine of himſelf, and the caſting away ſo precious a life.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:204181:64"/>was a perſon of conſiderable note in the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> both for his deſcent and for his education, and for his zeal in their Religion.
<note place="margin">iii. Phil. 5.</note> He was an <hi>Hebrew</hi> both by his Fathers ſide and his Mothers; a Scholar of <hi>Gamaliel</hi>'s,
<note place="margin">i. Gal. 14.</note> under whom he made an exceeding great proficiency;
<note place="margin">xxvi.

Theſe he held ſo ſacred, that the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was odious to him, becauſe he little regarded them. And he was tranſported with ſo bloudy a rage againſt his diſciples, that his intention was to ſend as many of them as he could meet withall after S. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to whoſe death he was conſenting,</hi> viii. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. xxii. 20. that is, He approved the fact of thoſe ſeditious Zealots, who were the authors of it; or, as the words may well be rendred out of the <hi>Syriack</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was as well pleaſed with the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of him as any of the company. The lenity of his Maſter was no example for him to follow. He learnt no meekneſs in the School of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> but ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be hurried away with the furious
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:204181:64"/>ſpirit of the multitude, whom he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied in that tumult. For he undertook to ſecure the garments of thoſe, who ſtript themſelves to throw the firſt ſtone at that bleſſed Martyr of Chriſt <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Nor did his fury reſt here, but he gave his voice againſt other Saints when the ſentence of death paſſed on them, xxvi. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. And not content to make havock of the poor Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he enlarged his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el projects and ſtretches his wrath as far as <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> thither he goes armed with authority from the Senate (xxii. 5.) whoſe Commiſſioner he was now, as he had been for ſome time: which ſhows he was a perſon of no ſmall condition in that Nation. For He tells us himſelf, that what he did at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was <hi>by authority from the chief Prieſts,</hi> xxvi. 10. who gave him <hi>letters</hi> alſo to thoſe at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> that they ſhould aſſiſt him in the apprehending all the Chriſtians that were there, ix. 2. xxii. 5. He brought the Decree of the Senate along with him, which had been made againſt them; and leſt any ſhould queſtion whether he was deputed to ſee that order put in execution, he was ready to ſatisfie them of that by ſhowing his Commiſſion, xxvi. 12. In ſhort, he breathed forth nothing but fire and ſword,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:204181:65"/>as we ſpeak, againſt the worſhippers of the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> being exceeding mad againſt them: according to the account S. <hi>Luke</hi> gives of him, viii. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. ix. 1. and which he gives of himſelf, xxii. 4. xxvi. 11.</p>
                        <p>Now who would expect that ſuch a man as this ſhould himſelf become a Diſciple of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> much leſs a preacher of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? A man ſo noted for his violence the other way, and whoſe name was ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to Chriſtian people, that <hi>Ananias</hi> was afraid to go and deliver a meſſage to him from our Lord, after he was told ſomething of his converſion? Was there any hopes that he ſhould ever confeſs and publiſh the very ſame thing for which S. <hi>Steven</hi> was ſtoned? And yet ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful were the prayers of that holy Martyr (which adds much to the force of his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony) that our Lord anſwered them ere long, by pardoning and converting this enraged Zealot. To whom he was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed to appear, as he had done to that Saint, more than once, as we find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Sacred ſtory from his own mouth.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> time, and the moſt remarkable
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:204181:65"/>was, when he was upon the rode to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus.</hi> Then our Lord met him, not far from that City (when he had no ſuch thing in his thoughts, but was poſſeſſed with quite contrary deſigns) and made him fall down and worſhip him, whoſe Name he ſo hated, that he would have forced all Chriſtians to blaſpheme him. Read the ix. <hi>Acts</hi> 3, &amp;c. and there you will find him, who little regarded what S. <hi>Steven</hi> ſaid, and perhaps took him for a frantick fellow when he told them he ſaw <hi>Jeſus</hi> glorified; ſurrounded himſelf with ſuch a glorious light from Heaven, as left him no power to reſiſt this truth, which he had ſo bitterly perſecuted. For in that wonderful brightneſs, there was a perſon appeared to him with ſuch a dazling luſtre, that after he had beheld it, he loſt his eyes, <hi>and could not ſee by reaſon of the glory of that light,</hi> xxii. 11. which was the cauſe I believe that he askt with no ſmall aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, <hi>Who art thou Lord?</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels appeared ſometimes in great glory, but never with ſuch a ſplendour as to hurt the ſight, much leſs to take it away; and therefore he now concluded that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was of an higher condition, much greater than the Angelical Miniſters, whoſe brightneſs was never known to be
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:204181:66"/>ſo amazing. And to give ſatisfaction to his doubt, our Lord, the WORD of God, told him in plain terms, with an audible voice, <hi>I am Jeſus whom thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteſt.</hi> And wiſht him not to proceed any further in this courſe, which he might eaſily ſee would prove deſtructive to him. For to contend with him ſtill who was ſo glorious, what would it be but to wound and ruine himſelf; and by ſeeking to eaſe himſelf of one trouble to run upon a greater; juſt as a beaſt does, that kicks againſt the pricks, which are to quicken it and put it forward? This voice he alone heard, who was to be inſtructed by it. The company that was with him, heard only a confuſed ſound (ix. 7.) and his voice perhaps when he askt that queſtion; but as they ſaw no body, ſo they <hi>did not hear the voice of him that ſpake to him,</hi> xxii. 9. But the light they all ſaw, and were ſo afraid that there they ſtopt their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and could not, for the preſent, ſtir a foot from that place. For that's the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>they stood ſpeechleſs,</hi> ix. 7. They did not ſtand on their feet, for they all fell to the ground (as you read, xxvi. 14.) but they remained fixt in that ſpot, and could neither ſpeak a word nor go on a ſtep further. As for <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf, he <hi>trembled
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:204181:66"/>and was aſtoniſhed;</hi> and began to yield himſelf preſently as a Captive to this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly King, ſaying, <hi>Lord, what wouldeſt thou have me to do?</hi> To this our Lord made him again a diſtinct anſwer (which ſhows this was no ſudden fancy, but that they continued for ſome time in a conference together) and bade him get up, and go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, and there he ſhould be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him what to do. Accordingly our Lord appeared in a Viſion to <hi>Ananias,</hi> who had the charge, it is likely, of the Church at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and ordered him to go in his name, and to lay his hands upon him for the reſtoring of his ſight (ix. 17.) after which he told him, that he muſt now go and tell all men <hi>what he had ſeen and what he had heard</hi> (xxii. 15.) that is, declare to all the world, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the King of glory. And which is ſtill more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf as he lay there praying to the Lord for mercy, had the like Viſion (ix. 12.) wherein he ſaw a man of this name coming in to do him this kindneſs. Who no ſooner had executed his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and put his hands upon him, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the power of our Lord appeared, after he himſelf in perſon was gone. His eyes were preſently opened, though they were ſealed up ſo faſt, as if a cruſt had grown over them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="108" facs="tcp:204181:67"/>And wonderful was the illumination of his underſtanding, together with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of his ſight. The light which had put out his eyes, made him clearly ſee, though he was not told ſo in expreſs words, that <hi>Jeſus was the Son of God.</hi> This Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly WORD, you may obſerve, doth not in all this ſtory call himſelf by that name. But he declaring himſelf to be <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> ſeeing this <hi>Jeſus</hi> in ſo bright a glory that it exceeded the light of the Sun at mid-day (as he confeſſes to <hi>Agrippe,</hi> xxvi. 13.) it did more than tell him that he was, as S. <hi>Steven</hi> had preached, <hi>the Son of God, the King of glory.</hi> For He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him in his glory, and then told him that he whom he beheld thus exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glorious, was that very <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom he was purſuing as a Blaſphemer, for affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to be that which he now ſaw him with his own eyes to be.</p>
                        <p>What could be more convincing than this? eſpecially when he felt himſelf filled with the holy Ghoſt (ix. 17.) merely by the laying on of the hands of one of <hi>Jeſus</hi> his Diſciples? He durſt not diſtruſt, much leſs reſiſt ſo clear and evident a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He ſaw there was nothing truer,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:204181:67"/>than that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> All his learning could not furniſh him with an argument to confute or weaken this ſingle proof which our Saviour gave him of his Divinity. But <hi>straight-way,</hi> upon this teſtimony from the WORD of God himſelf, without requiring any further demonſtration, <hi>He preached Chriſt in the Synagogues, that he is the Son of God,</hi> ix. 20. <hi>Ananias</hi> did not Catechiſe him in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, nor ſent him to the Apoſtles to be inſtructed; but He was made an Apoſtle as well as they, <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf (i. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.) who acquainted him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with his will, for he <hi>was not taught it, but by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt (ver.</hi> 12.) whom he preached, without asking counſel of any body (<hi>ver.</hi> 16.) as ſoon as God was pleaſed <hi>to reveal his Son in him.</hi> I believe you will eaſily grant that he was as hard as any man living to be perſwaded to receive this revelation, which would force him not only to contradict all that he had formerly maintained, but to condemn himſelf as the vileſt wretch in the world. To become a diſciple to this faith, and to aſſert it likewiſe ſo earneſtly as he did; what was it but to condemn, together with himſelf, all his Maſters, the grave Judges of the Nation, from whom he had
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:204181:68"/>received a commiſſion to deſtroy it? It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired great courage as well as honeſty to confeſs a Truth, which he knew, by himſelf, would be ſo furiouſly oppoſed. He had been ſuch a fiery perſecutor of all thoſe who believed it, that he had taught his Country-men how to deal with him, if he ſhould now become a proſelyte to it. He was a man alſo of very great parts and learning; and therefore was not like to be moved by a trivial argument. And a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon likewiſe of as great integrity, who did not bear a malice againſt Chriſtians, but was only zealous for the Law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not embrace a new Religion, unleſs he had learnt better reaſons for it, than thoſe which ſupported him in the old. Much leſs would he have ſuffered himſelf haſtily to be carried out of his way, unleſs he had met with ſome irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible arguments, which were able in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to turn him about, and incline him to the profeſſion of that truth, which he was then perſecuting with an outragious violence.</p>
                        <p>And yet ſo it was, that this man ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in another courſe, ſo certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done if he forſook it, of ſuch underſtanding and uprightneſs, was in a trice aſtoniſhed,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:204181:68"/>and reduced to ſuch a condition, that he could neither eat nor drink; and in three days ſpace ſo wrought upon, that <hi>straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> as you have heard, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deliberation or taking more time to ſtudy the point, He not only believed, but undertook to prove, that this perſon whom he had ſo zealouſly oppoſed, was indeed the <hi>Son of God.</hi> Muſt it not be ſome mighty Argument, that could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all thoſe reaſons and intereſts too which had engaged him in the contrary belief? Was it not a very clear demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which could open ſuch a mans eyes in a moment, and break through ſuch ſtrong oppoſition, as lay before his mind to bar its entrance? And yet it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but this teſtimony which the WORD bare to himſelf, that effected this wonderful change. Nothing but <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> appearing in glory, giving him a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible rebuke, and ſtriking him blind; which wrought ſuch a ſtrange cure upon him, that as he himſelf ſpeaks (i. <hi>Gal.</hi> 23.) He became <hi>a preacher of that faith, which once he deſtroyed.</hi> And therefore this Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot but be very powerful to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince every body elſe, which prevailed over a perſon ſo prejudiced and pre-enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in an oppoſite perſwaſion as <hi>Saul</hi> was.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:204181:69"/>Who took this Teſtimony, which our Lord had given to himſelf, to be ſo ſtrong and unanſwerable, that preſently after this, when he had further conſidered of the buſineſs and was increaſed in ſtrength, He even <hi>confounded the Jews that were at Damaſcus, proving that this is very Chriſt,</hi> ix. <hi>Acts</hi> 22. So mightily did he convince them, that they had no Anſwer where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to encounter his Arguments, but only the Sword: and therefore conſulted (<hi>ver.</hi> 23.) to kill him, and take him out of the way; who as long as he lived they ſaw would be the greateſt witneſs unto <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> But all theſe dangers he undervalued, he ran innumerable hazards, made ſtrange adventures, and indured matchleſs troubles; that he might give teſtimony to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who had ſhown himſelf to him to be the Lord of all. Nay, though he was told at his firſt ſetting out, <hi>how great things he muſt ſuffer for his Names ſake,</hi> ix. 16. he was nothing at all diſmayed, nor in the leaſt diſcouraged: having ſeen the bright Majeſty of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſo clearly, that flames themſelves could not make him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, no nor ceaſe to preach it.</p>
                        <p>So great was the force of this glorious appearance of our Lord to him, whereby
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:204181:69"/>he teſtified his own power and greatneſs; that when S. <hi>Paul</hi> was actually fallen into the hands of his bloudy enemies, and made a priſoner, in order to his executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; He had nothing of greater note to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for himſelf, by which to juſtifie his preaching <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the Son of God, than this; that he <hi>had ſeen that Juſt one, and heard the voice of his mouth;</hi> for no other end but this, <hi>That he ſhould be his witneſs unto all men, of what he had ſeen and heard,</hi> xxii. <hi>Acts</hi> 14, 15. And as this was the beſt plea he had when he was to make his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in that popular tumult, ſo it was the thing that convinced the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that he was become a diſciple. For they doubted of it at firſt, when he came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and were afraid to aſſociate themſelves with him, till <hi>Barnabas</hi> told them <hi>how he had ſeen the Lord in the way, and that he had ſpoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damaſcus, in the name of Jeſus,</hi> ix. 27. When he came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to anſwer for himſelf before <hi>Agrippa,</hi> a Prince of great underſtanding and well verſed in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, ſtill he ſtands upon this; that He who thought himſelf bound in conſcience to do many things contrary to the name of <hi>Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi> whoſe ſervants he procured to be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:204181:70"/>impriſoned, baniſhed, and put to death, was met by this very <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the way to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> (when he was going with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to do the ſame there that he had done at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) ſaw his exceeding great and incomparable glory; was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely rebuked by him for his rage againſt his diſciples, and then received a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from him to act in his name, and to preach againſt the former; all which was ſo evident, that he durſt not be diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Heavenly Viſion, but had ever ſince called upon both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> to repent and believe in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> though he had been crucified: for it was the Mind of all the Prophets and <hi>Moſes,</hi> that their <hi>Chriſt ſhould ſuffer and then be the firſt that ſhould riſe from the dead, and ſhew light to the people and to the Gentiles.</hi> This is the ſubſtance of his Apology in the xxvi. <hi>Acts,</hi> from which place we may learn <hi>two</hi> things, which are very conſiderable. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that when our Lord appeared to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> he had a great deal of diſcourſe with him, and did not ſay ſo little as only thoſe words, <hi>I am Jeſus whom thou perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,</hi> &amp;c. but added thoſe words which follow, <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17, 18. <hi>Riſe, and stand upon thy feet; for I have appeared unto thee for this purpoſe, to make thee a Miniſter and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:204181:70"/>a Witneſs both of theſe things which thou haſt ſeen, and of thoſe in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people and the Gentiles, unto whom now I ſend thee, to open their eyes and to turn them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, and from the power of Satan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance among them which are ſanctified by faith that is in me.</hi> The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine writers are wont to be very brief in their Relations, and to mention only the principal things which were ſaid and done, leaving out the reſt, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they ſet down upon ſome other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> in theſe words it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that he tells him he muſt be a witneſs not only of the <hi>things which he had ſeen</hi> (now in the way to <hi>Damaſcus</hi>) but of thoſe <hi>in which he intended to appear unto him.</hi> Which clearly intimates that there were other apparitions of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> unto him beſides this. Some of them we find recorded in this Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and other parts of the holy Book.</p>
                        <p>And a <hi>ſecond</hi> ſight which he had of our Lord was at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as he was praying in the Temple. When he fell into an ecſtaſie or rapture, as he relates himſelf preſently after the mention of the former
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:204181:71"/>(xxii. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.) and <hi>ſaw him;</hi> bidding him make haſte away from that City, where he was not like to do any good, <hi>for they would not receive his teſtimony concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.</hi> This was one of the times, as ſome great men have thought, when he was carried up to Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 2.</p>
                        <p>And again our Lord appeared to him the night after he had been queſtioned by the Council, bidding him be of good chear, for he ſhould bear witneſs of him at <hi>Rome,</hi> as he had done at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> xxiii. 11. And to omit that apparition to him in a night Viſion, xviii. 9. and the revelations which it is like were made to him in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> preſently after his converſion, He was caught up again into <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and there had <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Viſions,</hi> as well as Revelations, <hi>of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 1. When this was it is uncertain. But there are perſons of great note, who imagine, that when the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> laid hands on him (xiii. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.) not to ordain him an Apoſtle, for ſo he was made by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, but to ſend him out to exerciſe his Apoſtleſhip towards the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to which he had particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him; then our Lord vouchſafed to lift him up into Heaven, and to give him
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:204181:71"/>new Revelations. For there could be no time more fit for it than this, when he was to engage in a dangerous war againſt the whole Idolatrous world. Then he was armed with an extraordinary reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by converſation with Angels in the other world. Where he heard things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable, and was confirmed, no doubt, in the belief of the glory of the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by whoſe power he was thus tranſported; and whom, it is moſt likely, he then again ſaw, ſhining as the Sun among thoſe ſtars of light, in that Orb to which he was carried. But this he ſpeaks of ſo ſparingly himſelf, that I ought to paſs it over as faſt as he does.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>First</hi> is the chiefeſt and greateſt evidence of all: which he moſt depended on, and whereby he juſtified himſelf againſt all accuſers. This was his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; to this he appeals upon all occaſions, that <hi>He ſaw Jeſus in the way to Damaſcus.</hi> And he had great reaſon to ſtick to it; for he knew that no body could ſhame him, by ſo much as pretending that he lied, and that there was no ſuch thing as this appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of <hi>Jeſus</hi> to him. He had his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in his journey to be witneſſes of the Miraculous glory, which on a ſudden
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:204181:72"/>ſurpriſed them, as well as him, (xxvi. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.) They heard then the voice of ſome body diſcourſing with him, though they did not diſtinctly hear the words. It became preſently notorious every where; <hi>for this thing,</hi> as he tells <hi>Agrippa, ver.</hi> 26. <hi>was not done in a corner,</hi> but open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and at noon-day, to the aſtoniſhment of divers perſons who attended him. And it left a ſenſible effect upon his body, and upon his mind. He could neither ſee, nor eat, nor drink for three days. In which ſpace he ſaw a viſion of a man named <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> coming to him and bidding him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his ſight. All which proved true; and together with his ſight he received a new ſpirit, whereby he confounded the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> For they could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all this, and yet were loth to believe in <hi>Jeſus.</hi> They were amazed to hear him preached by a man, who they knew was come thither with a quite contrary intent, ix. 21. They could not but ask, what is the matter? whence comes this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous change? <hi>Is not this he that destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them which called on this Name in Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem? And is not that the buſineſs for which he came hither, to bring them bound unto the chief Priests?</hi> What ailes him now, that he thus juſtifies them and condemns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:204181:72"/>And there is no doubt, but to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſuch Queſtions he took the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to tell them, <hi>what he had ſeen and what he had heard;</hi> for ſo <hi>Ananias</hi> charged him, xxii. 15. He did not keep this as a ſecret; it was not carried in privacy, but preſently divulged, that all might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, if they pleaſed, into the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the fact. Which was ſo ſtrange, that as it amazed and confounded them at <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> ſo King <hi>Agrippa'</hi> knew not what to ſay to it, but was <hi>almost perſwaded to be a Christian,</hi> xxvi. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.</p>
                        <p>No man of ſence could think that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his education and learning would venture the loſs of his eaſe, of his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of all the preferment he had, and of all that he might juſtly hope for from the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> without the leaſt expectation of any gain, unleſs of that only which <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> could give him; if he had not been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured it was no deluſion, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf to him as the Lord of glory. Much leſs could any man imagine, that a perſon of his vertue and unblameable life under the Law, and of ſuch ſtrange piety and perfect contempt of all worldly things after his receiving Chriſtianity, would feign and deviſe ſuch a ſtory; by which if
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:204181:73"/>it were falſe he could get nothing in the other world, and if it were true he could get nothing in this. Nothing but miſery, trouble, infamy and reproach, which attended him every where, and never left him till it had brought him to a ſhameful death. If you will but conſider what he quitted for Chriſt's ſake, after he had thus appeared to him, and how the world treated him when he became a preacher of this Goſpel (as you find it deſcribed by himſelf in ſeveral Epiſtles, particularly iii. <hi>Philip.</hi> 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 9, 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> xi. 23, 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) you will ſoon be ſatisfied that he was more in his wits, than either to invent this ſtory, or publiſh it without ſtrong aſſurance of its truth. He was as ſure that he <hi>ſaw the Lord Jeſus in his glory,</hi> and <hi>heard the voice of his mouth,</hi> as every body elſe that knew him was ſure, he had been a blaſphemer of him and a perſecutor of his ſervants. And therefore whatſoever it coſt him, he would be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to that Heavenly Viſion. And <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Ministry</hi> from him (as he ſpeaks in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 1, 2, 3.) <hi>according as he had received mercy</hi> (ſo he accounted it, a very great favour to become one of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) <hi>he did not faint,</hi> nor diſcharge his office ſluggiſhly. Nor did he think of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:204181:73"/>making up his loſſes by this new profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of preaching the Goſpel, but abhorred ſuch a diſhoneſt thought, and utterly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all ſuch baſe and ſhameful arts,</hi> though never ſo <hi>ſecretly</hi> managed, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with never ſuch ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. He did not <hi>walk in craftineſs,</hi> nor appear other than he really was. Much leſs would he to pleaſe any men, <hi>handle the word of God deceitfully;</hi> either by conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing that was true, or by mixing any falſe ſtories of his own inventing. No, by <hi>plain truth he commended himſelf to every mans conſcience, as in the preſence of that God,</hi> who is the avenger of all fraud and impoſture. And therefore he juſtly concludes, that if any man did not receive theſe things, nor think them evident enough, it was becauſe he deſerved to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, for the love he bore to ſome naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affection or other, which would not let him ſubmit to <hi>Jeſus.</hi> For it was <hi>him</hi> the Apoſtles preached (<hi>ver.</hi> 5.) not <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> they did not do their own buſineſs, but his only, whom they proclaimed to be the <hi>Lord,</hi> and themſelves no more but his <hi>ſervants;</hi> nay, the ſervants of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an people for his ſake.</p>
                        <p>But I muſt no longer follow the ſtory of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:204181:74"/>this great man, who became <hi>ſo strong in the Lord and in the power of his might,</hi> after He had from Heaven appeared and ſpoken to him; that as nothing could daunt him, ſo nothing could hinder the ſuceceſs of his labours. He became the moſt eminent ſervant of the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and prevailed ſo mightily againſt all the oppoſition which the Devil or men raiſed to fruſtrate his endeavours, that he gives thanks to God, in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Chapter of that Epiſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Who always cauſed him to triumph in Chriſt, and made manifeſt the odour of his knowledge by him in every place.</hi> All his travels and long journeys proved in the iſſue, as if they had been but the carrying of him about in a triumphal Chariot, to make him a glorious ſpectacle in all thoſe places (as the <hi>Syriack</hi> tranſlates it) where, in ſpite of all that the moſt powerful cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and rage could do, he was ſtill victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and brought divers Souls into a chearful ſubjection to his Maſter Chriſt <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>

There could not be a fitter perſon than he, who perhaps alſo
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:204181:75"/>was the only Apoſtle now remaining in the world, to hold communication with this WORD of God, and receive new revelations from <hi>Jeſus.</hi> He being at this time likewiſe baniſhed and confined to <hi>the Iſle which is called Patmos, ver.</hi> 9. for the cauſe now named, that is, <hi>for the Word of God, and for the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In this loneſome place, ſeparated from the reſt of the Earth, our Lord opened Heaven to him, and ſhewed him the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which he had there. For he fell into a rapture on the <hi>Lords day</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 10.) and heard one ſpeak behind him with a voice as loud as a trumpet, ſaying, <hi>I am before and after all things,</hi> that is, God bleſſed for ever; <hi>Write what thou ſeeſt in a Book, and ſend it to the ſeven Churches which are in Aſia,</hi> whoſe names are there expreſſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. Whereupon he turn'd about to ſee whence this voice came, and then he beheld in the midſt of <hi>ſeven golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,</hi> repreſenting thoſe Churches, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glorious perſon, appearing in the moſt royal majeſty and power. He did not ask him, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did, who he was; for he had been long acquainted heretofore with that countenance, and knew him perfectly well to be our bleſſed Saviour. Who, by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:204181:75"/>his very habit wherein he appeared, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf to be, as he had ſaid, the Lord of all; who had no ſuperiour, nor any ſecond, in that Kingdom which God the Father had given him, but diſpoſed all things according to the ſole pleaſure of his will. For he beheld him, <hi>clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16. He ſaw, that is, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> truly expreſſes it,

For a long Robe and a golden Girdle, belonged both to Kings, and to the High-Prieſt in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation. And all the reſt of the deſcription, it were eaſie to ſhow, is a plain repreſentation of a perſon ſhining in the glory of God the Father; and inveſted with ſuch an irreſiſtible power in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, as might juſty make all his Friends rejoyce, who acknowledged him to be the <hi>Son of God</hi> moſt high, and all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies quake and tremble, who oppoſed his ſovereign Authority. In ſhort, ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous was the ſight, that S. <hi>John</hi> himſelf was not able to bear it, but when he ſaw him, fell at his feet as dead, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. till the WORD (as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſpeaks in the ſame place) on whoſe breaſt he had repoſed
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:204181:76"/>himſelf at his laſt Supper, revived and comforted him with theſe gracious words; <hi>Fear not, I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore,</hi> Amen; <hi>and have the keys of Hell and of Death.</hi> As much as to ſay, <q>Thou waſt not deceived when thou thoughteſt thou ſaw <hi>the Son of man</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to thee. It is I indeed, therefore be not ſo afraid, though now thou behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt me in ſuch Heavenly Majeſty and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory; for thou oughteſt rather to rejoyce to think that I am the eternal God. I whom thou kneweſt when I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon Earth, and whom thou ſaweſt ſhamefully put to death, am now alive, as thou ſeeſt alſo, never to die any more; and am intruſted with a power to reſcue you from death, and raiſe you out of your graves.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>It would be too long, if I ſhould tell you all that he ſays in his Letters to thoſe Churches, to aſſert his title to the Name of the <hi>[Son of God]</hi> which he expreſly takes to himſelf in one of them (ii. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.) and to declare his royal power which he exerciſes in all the world, eſpecially in his Church, the houſe of the living God; where he hath ſuch an abſolute authority
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:204181:76"/>(expreſſed by having <hi>the keys of the houſe of David,</hi> &amp;c. iii. 7.) that none can contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict him, either by preſerving any man in the Divine favour, if he reject him; or by excluding any man from it, if he receive him. It may ſuffice to obſerve theſe two things. <hi>First,</hi> that there is not one of thoſe Letters but it begins with ſome ſuch deſcription of our Saviour's ſovereign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as this now mentioned. For the character he had given of himſelf in the firſt Chapter, is again repeated, by parts, in the following meſſages to the Churches. Where he ſometimes calls himſelf, <hi>He that walks in the midst of the ſeven golden candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,</hi> ii. 1. that is, inſpects and governs them. Sometime the <hi>first and the last, which was dead and is alive, ver.</hi> 8. that is, the Lord God, who can raiſe him from the dead, who parts with his life for me. And, to name no more, he calls himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>He that hath the ſharp ſword with two edges,</hi> to cut in pieces either them or their enemies, according as they deſerved of him. And indeed it being the office of a King (which is the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) or a ſupreme Governour, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh offenders, and to reward vertuous perſons; he conſtantly aſſumes both theſe powers to himſelf, in every one of theſe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:204181:77"/>
                           <hi>ſeven</hi> Letters: telling them what evil ſhould befall them from his hand, if they did not amend; and what bleſſings he would beſtow upon them, if they did overcome. Which is a plain declaration of his Regal power and authority, which he now hath at the right hand of the Throne of God.</p>
                        <p>There S. <hi>John</hi> ſaw him in a ſecond Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> calls it, v. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. where he appears in ſuch power with God, that none hath the like. For there was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty repreſented to the Apoſtle, ſitting on a Throne, with a Book in <hi>his right hand (ver.</hi> 1.) which none could open, or read, or ſo much as look into. And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, this Lamb of God, who had been ſlain, comes and appears in <hi>the midſt of the Throne;</hi> being the <hi>Lyon</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as one of the Elders calls him, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. that royal perſon whom God promiſed to ſend to rule over them. He takes the Book out of the right hand of him that ſate on the Throne, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. which ſignifies that he is next to God the Father of all, at whoſe right hand he ſtood, in power and glory. As appears alſo by his being ſeated in his Throne (for the thrones of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Kings, to which theſe expreſſions
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:204181:77"/>allude, were wide, like one of our Couches, in which more than one may ſit) and by his having the principal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the <hi>ſeven ſpirits of God</hi> at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to imploy where he pleaſed. Who, together with the reſt of the Heavenly hoſt and with the Chriſtian Church, make their acclamations to him (<hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12.) as worthy of the moſt ſupreme power and dignity, which they expreſs in as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Names of praiſe, as there are principal Spirits of God; when they ſay, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain to receive</hi> 1. <hi>power, and</hi> 2. <hi>riches, and</hi> 3. <hi>wiſdom, and</hi> 4. <hi>strength, and</hi> 5. <hi>honour, and</hi> 6. <hi>glory, and</hi> 7. <hi>bleſſing.</hi> And then immediately he hears every Creature joyning him in their Doxology, together with God the Father, ſaying, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the more fully to repreſent his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, you may obſerve that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in another Viſion to him, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame ſtate and majeſty, wherein God was wont to make himſelf preſent, in the times of old. Then you read that the Lord <hi>made the clouds his chariot, and walkt upon
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:204181:78"/>the wings of the wind,</hi> ciii. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 3. that is, came to them by the miniſtery of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who appeared in bright and ſhining clouds, to do his will with great expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion every where. For ſo it is expounded in the xviii. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 10. where inſtead of <hi>clouds</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>He rode upon a Cherub and did flie, yea, he did flie upon the wings of the wind.</hi> That is, there was a token of his preſence by the majeſtick appearance of Angels, who were ready to be imployed by him, and immediately to execute his commands. For <hi>to ride</hi> upon any thing, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> obſerves

And therefore <hi>to ride upon a Cherub,</hi> or to <hi>make the clouds his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi> (which are the very ſame, becauſe the Angels appeared in glorious clouds) is to ſend thoſe Heavenly Miniſters whither he thinks good, to perform his pleaſure. Whence it is, I ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays elſewhere (lxviii. 34.) <hi>his strength is in the clouds,</hi> becauſe he is powerfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by them in all places.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:204181:78"/>imployed in them;</hi> becauſe they are above us, and are very ſwift, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are in their motions, and are both dark and bright; a fit emblem of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Divine Majeſty which is inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by us.</p>

So he tells us in xiv. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. <hi>And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one ſate, like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden Crown, and in his hand a ſharp ſickle.</hi> Where by <hi>cloud,</hi> the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned writer underſtands, <gap reason="foreign">

For S. <hi>John</hi> ſaw him upon this cloud; and <hi>ſitting</hi> there, as if it were the Throne or Royal Chariot of this Prince. Who ſate there with a <hi>Crown on his head,</hi> denoting his Royal authority; and that <hi>of Gold,</hi> to ſhow, by what is moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous among us, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the ſplendour and greatneſs of his Majeſty; and with a <hi>ſickle in his hand,</hi> to ſignifie that he hath
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:204181:79"/>ſuch a power, as to be able to cut down Kingdoms and States, with as much eaſe as we mow a field of corn. All theſe <hi>three</hi> laſt expreſſions ſet forth the higheſt digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and moſt royal power; and therefore ſo doth his <hi>ſitting upon a cloud,</hi> or being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by Angels, as Kings were anciently and ſtill are in the Eaſtern Countries by their ſervants. Which kind of ſpeech, and other ſuch like phraſes in the holy Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (as <hi>riding upon the wings</hi> of Angels, denoted by the <hi>clouds</hi> and <hi>wind</hi>) ſignifie the exerciſe of his Kingly power by their Miniſtry. Who are ready to fly any whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to convey his orders, and execute them throughout the world. Where he being preſent by them, as a King is by his ſeveral Miniſters in every part of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, he is ſaid to <hi>ſit upon them,</hi> as if, whither-ſoever they go, they carried him. Thus the ancient Books ſpeak of God the Creator and Governour of all; and thus our Saviour teaches S. <hi>John</hi> to ſpeak of him: which is a ſign that he is the Son of God, <hi>who ſends forth the Angels to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster for them eſpecially, who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And therefore in another Viſion, which is all I need mention, xix. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           <pb n="133" facs="tcp:204181:79"/>He ſaw him again coming out of Heaven, with the Royal enſigns of his victorious power over thoſe who had oppoſed his authority. For, <hi>behold a white horſe,</hi> which was proper for a conqueror, and one ſitting upon him, whoſe name was called the <hi>WORD of God.</hi> Who was <hi>clothed,</hi> he tells us, <hi>with a veſture dipt in bloud;</hi> that is, with a purple garment, ſuch as Kings uſe to wear; and <hi>his eyes</hi> ſparkled, or rather <hi>flamed like fire,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note how terrible he was to his Enemies; and <hi>there were on his head many Crowns,</hi> becauſe he had already conquered ſeveral Kingdoms and Provinces and was now going to ſubdue more: being attonded with <hi>all the armies in Heaven,</hi> who wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him to miniſter to him in this war, till, as he was of right, he was actually acknowledged, by humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him, to be KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</p>
                        <p>And what greater argument can there be of the power of our Lord, and of the truth of theſe Viſions (whereby the WORD of God, who hath the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of future things in his mind, as <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus ſpeaks,</hi> repreſented how God would
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:204181:80"/>hereafter diſpoſe of the affairs of the world) than his poſſeſſing himſelf of a Kingdom, and perſwading ſo great a part of mankind to ſubmit to him, though a King inviſible, merely by the preaching of ſuch men as S. <hi>John?</hi> The event hath proved, it was no deluſion when he heard thoſe <hi>great voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> in Heaven ſaying, xi. 15. <hi>The Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for ever and ever.</hi> Which was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed alſo with very great ſpeed, as he ſaw repreſented by an Angel which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>flying</hi> in the midſt of Heaven, xiv. 6. <hi>Having the everlaſting Goſpel to preach unto them that dwell on the Earth.</hi> That motion of <hi>flying</hi> ſeems to ſignifie the haſte which the great Miniſters of Chriſt made (who are compared in this book to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels) to publiſh his Goſpel to the world. Which had mighty ſucceſs, becauſe it came with authority from Heaven, as is repreſented by the Angels flying <gap reason="foreign">

The greateſt powers on Earth indeed ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt it, and <hi>made war with the Lamb,</hi> xvii. 14. that is, perſecuted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:204181:80"/>But he foretells his conqueſts, even over theſe Kingdoms who were ſuch furious enemies, as to ſeek to deſtroy his Religion. For which he gives only theſe two reaſons; becauſe God had made him <hi>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings;</hi> and becauſe thoſe who followed him were ſuch <hi>choice perſons,</hi> that their patient conſtant perſeverance in his ſervice, to which he had called them, helpt to overcome his and their Enemies, and to bring them in ſubjection to him.</p>
                        <p>I can think of nothing that can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt what hath been ſaid, but two things, which deſerve briefly to be conſidered. One of them concerns this laſt particular now handled, and the other ſeems to croſs all that hath been delivered in this Chapter. Againſt what hath now been alledged from the Revelations, it may be objected, that this Book of Viſions was doubted of among ſome of the ancient Chriſtians. To which the Anſwer is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obvious, That there was a particular reaſon why this Book did not always go along with the reſt into every bodies hands, and by that means, being not ſo generally known, was afterward queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; becauſe the making of it as publick
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:204181:81"/>as the Chriſtian doctrine, might have too much incenſed the power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, whoſe downfall is here ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly predicted. Yet it was not kept ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, but that it is cited very early both as a Divine Book, and as the writing of S. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, by thoſe who deſerve to be believed. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> had that opinion of it, and ſo had <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> as I have already ſaid, and <hi>Theophilus Antioche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>Origen;</hi> eſpecially S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who, I have obſerved, produces teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies out of no book of the New Teſtament ſo oft as this. From whence he encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Chriſtians to follow their Maſter and all that worthy company who had hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their lives for him. <hi>It being the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar glory,</hi> ſaith he
<note n="*" place="margin">De Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</note>, <hi>of our time, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ancient examples might be numbred, now there is ſuch an exuberant abundance of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and faith, that Christian Martyrs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. So the Revelation witneſſes, I beheld, and lo a great multitude which no man could number, of all nations, and kindred, and people, and tongues stood before the Throne, and before the Lamb with white robes and palms in their hands,</hi> vii. 9. <hi>And theſe,</hi> he was told, <hi>are they which came out of great tribulation, and have waſhed their robes, and made them white in the bloud of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:204181:81"/>Lamb.</hi> I ſhall not produce the words of any of the reſt, nor of divers others, who without any manner of doubting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this to be the <hi>Revelation of the WORD of God to his ſervant John.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But paſs to the other thing, which may be alledged to the prejudice of the whole foregoing diſcourſe. For I produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſome may ſay, but the teſtimony which one gives of himſelf, which all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be of no validity. This WORD of God himſelf ſaith ſo, as this very Apoſtle hath recorded, v. <hi>John</hi> 31. <hi>If I bear witneſs of my ſelf, my witneſs is not true.</hi> And yet what is all that S. <hi>Steven</hi> ſaw, or that he ſpake to S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> but his witneſs of himſelf?</p>
                        <p>I anſwer in his own words alſo, which you read in another place of that Goſpel, viii. 14. where the <hi>Phariſees</hi> objecting to him his own conceſſion (<hi>ver.</hi> 13.) that a mans teſtimony to himſelf is nothing worth; he ſeems to revoke, but in truth only explains it, by telling them in terms quite contrary, <hi>though I bear record of my ſelf, my record is true.</hi> The former words are not ſo to be underſtood, as if what a man ſays of himſelf were always falſe, or not to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:204181:82"/>be regarded when he hath a concurrent teſtimony from others; no, it may be <hi>true,</hi> though it will perſwade no body elſe to believe it without other evidence. That's all our Saviour means in the <hi>Fifth</hi> Chapter, if he had alone born witneſs to himſelf, and there had been no other teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony given him, it had not been <hi>true,</hi> that is, not a valid, unexceptionable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, by which he might demand cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit from them. So the word <hi>true</hi> is uſed, viii. <hi>John</hi> 17. in the ſence of the Law, which required two or three witneſſes for the eſtabliſhing or ſetling any thing in queſtion. They had no reaſon to believe he was Gods Son, but might ſtill have diſputed it, if he had been the only perſon that ſaid ſo, and could have brought no other to witneſs for him. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding He tells them here, that even in this caſe his teſtimony of himſelf is <hi>true,</hi> as truth is oppoſed to falſhood; though it wanted that truth which was neceſſary to make it a legal teſtimony. That is, though it could not have paſſed in Law, nor ſtopt the mouth of gainſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, becauſe it was a ſingle teſtimony, and the Law required more than one; yet it would have had nothing of a lie in it, but his words would have been perfectly <hi>true,</hi>
                           <pb n="139" facs="tcp:204181:82"/>when he affirmed himſelf to be the <hi>Son of God.</hi>

And therefore his teſtimony, which ſingle would have had no ſtrength, being joyned to the other is of great force, and ought to be regarded. He did not deſire to be received merely becauſe he ſaid he was the Son of God (though he ought not to be accounted a liar for ſaying ſo alone) no, he referred them to other proof of that truth. But when they had heard and conſidered them, then there was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they ſhould hear what he affirmed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf: and not think the worſe of him, becauſe he ſpake thoſe words, which were no other than the very words of the Father, whereby he bare witneſs to him. So he tells them in the viii. <hi>John</hi> 17, 18. <hi>It is written in your Law, that the teſtimony of two men is true. I am one that bear witneſs of my ſelf, and the Father that ſent me beareth witneſs of me.</hi> That is, you have no reaſon to diſparage my teſtimony
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:204181:83"/>
                           <hi>of my ſelf, becauſe I do but repeat the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame thing which the Father hath ſaid before me. For though alone (as I have confeſſed heretofore) my teſtimony</hi> of my ſelf is worth nothing, and cannot chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge belief; yet added unto ſo high a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony as his, it ought to be duly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and accepted.</p>
                        <p>But beſides this, I muſt add another conſideration of great moment. Which is, that the Teſtimony of the WORD concerning himſelf now that he is <hi>in the Heavens</hi> is of great validity, even ſingly conſidered; though it had no ſuch autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity alone, when he was <hi>upon the Earth.</hi> For during his ſtay here <hi>on Earth,</hi> it could not appear by his bare ſaying ſo, that he was the <hi>Son of God, the King of Iſrael;</hi> becauſe he was in a poor, mean and low condition, altogether unlike a King: And therefore if the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> had not teſtified ſo much, none could have believed on him. But when he was <hi>in the Heavens,</hi> then what he ſaid of himſelf carried great authority and power with it; becauſe he could not ſay thoſe words to any one, but he muſt appear as a King in glory. There were things as well as words to ſpeak for him. At the ſame
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:204181:83"/>time that he bare witneſs of himſelf, they to whom he ſpake muſt needs ſee the truth of his Teſtimony, by the royal ſtate and majeſty wherein they beheld him.</p>
                        <p>If the queſtion ſhould be, whether a perſon be alive; his own appearing in Court would be the beſt teſtimony that could be given of it. If whether ſuch a one be a King, his ſitting upon his Throne with his Crown on his head, in his royal Palace, and his Miniſters round about him, would be the ſureſt evidence that could be deſired to put it out of doubt. In this caſe therefore where the queſtion is, whether <hi>Jeſus</hi> be the Son of God or no; there cannot be expected a better reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, than his own witneſs to himſelf, by appearing upon the Throne of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. There ſeveral perſons of unblemiſhed credit beheld him, and had the confidence to venture their lives upon the certain knowledge they had that they were not deceived. From thence he ſpake to them, and directed them to ſpeak and carry his meſſages to others, that they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Name of the Son of God. And let it but be remembred (which I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the beginning) that we are now examining thoſe witneſſes which ſpeak
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:204181:84"/>from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and not thoſe which ſpeak on the <hi>Earth;</hi> and then you will ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that theſe teſtimonies of the WORD, though concerning himſelf, ought to be received with great reverence, and to be judged very full and powerful to prove <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> to be the Son of God. Eſpecially, ſince beſides his own word for it, we have alſo the word of the Father, who ſeveral times called him his Son, and that before he took this honour to himſelf.</p>

                     <p>WE have heard the WORD ſpeak enough in his own behalf; and I do not think it needful to hear that <hi>Witneſs</hi> any further. Let us attend now to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the third perſon in the holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hear what the HOLY GHOST ſaith; who we ſhall find, upon due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, agrees perfectly in the ſame thing, and declares that <hi>Jeſus is the Son of God.</hi> Witneſs that glorious appearance of the Divine Spirit upon him when he was baptized, and the great gifts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments thereof, wherewith ever after that he was filled himſelf and filled others. For here we may note <hi>three</hi> things, as we did in the opening of the teſtimony of the other two <hi>Witneſſes.</hi>

                        <head>I.</head>
                        <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is that when the Spirit of God <hi>deſcended</hi> upon him, immediately after his Baptiſm, and in an illuſtrious manner <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained</hi> on him (as S. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt teſtifies it did, i. <hi>John</hi> 32, 33.) then the Holy Ghoſt bare witneſs of him, that he was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> In our reflections upon which, we are to conſider diſtinctly firſt how it <hi>deſcended,</hi> and then that it <hi>remained</hi> and abode upon him.</p>
                        <p>And for the better underſtanding of both theſe we muſt know, that when the <hi>Jews</hi> would expreſs any viſible appearance of the Majeſty and glory of God, they call it the SCHEKINAH, that is, the <hi>Habitation</hi> or <hi>dwelling;</hi> becauſe God ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf thereby to be extraordinarily preſent, and that he did, as it were, <hi>dwell</hi> in that place, to afford thoſe, to whom he ſo manifeſted himſelf, his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous help, comfort, or inſtruction. This is the name they give even to that Preſence of God which was in the moſt holy place [the Glory of the Lord which appeared upon the Cherubims] becauſe He dwelt there, and took up his reſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:204181:87"/>among them, by this token of his preſence with them. So He himſelf had ſpoken, xxv. <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. <hi>Let them make me a Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that I may DWELL among them.</hi> That is, <hi>the Glory of the Lord, which ABODE upon mount Sinai</hi> (xxiv. 16.) came and took up its reſidence there in the Sanctuary. From theſe two places, they gave it the name of <hi>dwelling</hi> or <hi>abode.</hi> 
                           <q>And tell us, that from the day that this <hi>Schekinah,</hi> as they ſpeak, or Divine preſence dwelling among them, reſted on mount <hi>Sinai</hi> at the giving of the Law; it never departed from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> till the deſtruction of the houſe of the firſt San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary by the King of <hi>Babylon:</hi> after that the Divinity or this glorious token of the Divine preſence did not dwell among them.</q> They are the words of <hi>R. Bechai</hi> upon <hi>Gen.</hi> xlv.</p>
                        <p>But that which had been ſo long abſent, returned now in a far more glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than ever: not to dwell in an houſe of ſtone; but in <hi>the Temple of our Saviours body,</hi> as he calls, ii. <hi>John</hi> 21. For when <hi>Jeſus</hi> was baptized, <hi>Lo, the Heavens were opened unto him, and he ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending like a Dove, and lighting upon him,</hi> iii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. Every word of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:204181:88"/>this verſe is very obſervable. For the <hi>opening of the Heavens</hi> in the prophetical writings (as <hi>Grotius</hi> hath obſerved upon xix. <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.) ſtill precedes ſome great Viſion. And that which he with <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt now ſaw, was the <hi>Spirit of God;</hi> that is, ſuch a glorious appearance of the Divine majeſty, as I before mentioned. For the Rabbins often call the <hi>Ruach Hak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kodeſh,</hi> or the HOLY GHOST by the name of <hi>Schekinah,</hi> or the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, gloriouſly appearing among them. So <hi>Elias</hi> expreſly tells us in his <hi>Tisbi</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Vocab.</hi>

                           </note>, and gives this reaſon for it, <hi>becauſe it reſted or dwelt upon the Prophets,</hi> and was a great token (I may add) of God's preſence with them. Whence it is, that where the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Text (as he goes on) ſaith, <hi>The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jacob revived,</hi> xlv. <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. <hi>R. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> expounds it thus, the <hi>Schekinah,</hi> or the HOLY GHOST reſted on him; which was departed, and, as it were, extinct before, becauſe of the grief and ſorrow wherein he had been drown'd. For the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſay they, reſts not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the melancholy, but only on thoſe who are of a chearful ſpirit. Thus when <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Eli,</hi> who fancied ſhe was drunk, <hi>No, my Lord, I am a woman of a ſorrowful ſpirit;</hi> the <hi>Talmud</hi> expounds it in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:204181:88"/>this manner, <hi>Thou art not to govern in this caſe, the Schekinah and the Holy Ghoſt is not upon thee,</hi> as appears <hi>by this, that thou haſt judged me guilty when I am innocent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is all one then in their Language (as I obſerved alſo before, in the concluſion of the ſecond Chapter) to ſay that the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty,</hi> or that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is upon any perſon. And therefore I doubt not but there was a glorious appearance of the Majeſty of God at our Saviours Baptiſm; ſome great unuſual brightneſs, ſignifying the Divine preſence and the Spirit of God coming to dwell in him. It is not indeed mentioned in expreſs words, that there was ſuch a <hi>Schekinah</hi> or Majeſtical appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Glory of the Lord; but it muſt be underſtood to be meant by the <gap reason="foreign">

And <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> ſaith expreſly, in his diſputation with the <hi>Jew,</hi> that at our Saviours Baptiſm, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:204181:89"/>among the ancient <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> which had, I told you, the reſemblance of a very bright fire. Which ſo good a man would not have had the boldneſs to affirm, if it had not been the conſtant tradition which paſſed among them; or rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſence they put upon this place. Juſt as when the Apoſtles were baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, a fiery ſubſtance gathered it ſelf about their heads, in token of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſence among them; ſo when our Lord himſelf was baptized with water, there was the like but far more glorious appearance: which ſpreading it ſelf from his head round about, made the River out of which he was newly come, look as if it were on a flame, as a ſign that he ſhould baptize, <hi>not with water, but with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire.</hi> And ſo <hi>Grotius</hi> hath obſerved, that in the Goſpel of the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi> there were theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

All which make it apparent, that Holy men thus underſtood the deſcent of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as I have explained it. And indeed S. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, iii. 22. that it deſcended, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:204181:89"/>ſome viſible matter broke out of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, which being the place of light and glory, we can expound to be nothing elſe but ſome very ſplendid body, a bright ſhining Light, formed by the Spirit of God, which <hi>came down</hi> from above, juſt <hi>as a Dove</hi> with wings ſpread is obſerved to do, and <hi>lighted upon</hi> our Saviours head.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>three</hi> laſt phraſes are remarkable.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:204181:90"/>come and reſt upon any perſon. It could denote him to be no leſs than the <hi>Holy one of God:</hi> From whom, as from Gods moſt holy place, he would hereafter communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all his bleſſings to men.</p>
                        <p>And the more fully to expreſs this, it is very obſervable, that the <hi>glory</hi> which now appeared came down <hi>as a Dove</hi> doth: which is the very manner wherein <hi>R. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> deſcribes the deſcent of the Divine majeſty in former times. <hi>The Throne of God</hi> (ſaith he, upon thoſe words, i. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>The Spirit of God moved,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>stood in the air, and hovered over the face of the waters, by the Spirit of his mouth who is moſt bleſſed, and by his Word, just AS A DOVE stretches her wings over her Neſt.</hi> For it is not certain whether this glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance had the form of a Dove, or only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in the ſame manner as a Dove doth, when it came upon our Saviour, and encircled his head.</p>
                        <p>But that there was ſuch a <hi>glorious Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi> appeared and lighted on him, ought not to ſeem incredible to any man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Holy Books of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as <hi>Origen</hi>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:204181:91"/>againſt this apparition. If he had made an <hi>Epicuraean,</hi> ſaith He, deride this report, there had been ſome congruity in it: but it is ridiculous to pin ſuch words upon a <hi>Jew,</hi> who believes things altogether as ſtrange, nay, far more wonderful. To paſs by what we read that God ſaid to <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham</hi> and others, what doth he think concerning <hi>Ezekiel?</hi> who ſays that <hi>the Heavens were opened, and he ſaw Viſions of God,</hi> i. 1. and <hi>ver.</hi> 28. That <hi>this was the appearance of the likeneſs of the glory of the Lord.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Iſaiah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports concerning himſelf, <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon a Throne,</hi> &amp;c. vi. 1. Which of theſe are more to be credited; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> who ſays <hi>the Heavens were opened,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who writes that he <hi>ſaw the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. or <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who ſays that <hi>the Heavens were opened to him, and he ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending like a Dove, and lighting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him?</hi> This is enough to ſtop the mouth <q>of any <hi>Jew,</hi> eſpecially ſince the power of <hi>Jeſus</hi> (as <hi>Origen</hi> proceeds) not only then when he was on earth far excelled theirs: but ſtill remains now that he is in Heaven, for the converſion and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment of thoſe, who by him believe in God.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="157" facs="tcp:204181:91"/>And as for others, He tells <hi>Celſus,</hi> that all thoſe who admit Providence, confeſs that God hath ſometimes forewarned men in their ſleep, of things which much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned their ſafety. And therefore it is no ſuch ſtrange thing, if that power which figures the mind in a dream, ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſame or the like form upon it, when a man is awake: and repreſent things as ſenſibly to him, as if he ſaw them with his eyes and heard them with his ears. And why that ſhould not be as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeen, if God pleaſe, which is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to a man in his imagination; no body can give any reaſon.</p>
                        <p>As for that which <hi>Celſus</hi> objects, that the Goſpel never tells us, our Saviour was wont to mention this and appeal to it, in his preaching to the people; He tells him that he did not mind how unſeemly it was for our Saviour to divulge himſelf what was ſeen and heard at <hi>Jordan,</hi> who forbad his Diſciples to publiſh that which they beheld and heard on the holy Mount. There was a fit time for the open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of both, by others, not by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For the manners of our Saviour were far from that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, vain oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:204181:92"/>and much talk of himſelf, which ſuch a man as <hi>Celſus</hi> might be guilty of. He choſe by his works, rather than by his words, to tell them that he was the Chriſt. Which made the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, <hi>How long doſt thou hold us in ſuſpence? If thou be the Chriſt, tell us plainly,</hi> x. <hi>John</hi> 24. So he did, but it was by that which was more convincing than his teſtimony of himſelf could then be. <hi>I told you and ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not: the works that I do in my Fathers name, they bear witneſs of me, ver.</hi> 25. That one work which he had wrought juſt before, was ſo miraculous, that the like had not been heard of ſince the world began, ix. 32. For he had opened the eyes of a man who was born blind; as they themſelves could not deny; for the mans Parents teſtified that he could never ſee till now; and he affirmed it was <hi>Jeſus</hi> who had given him his ſight. If they had not been blinder than He, this might have opened their eyes to ſee who our Saviour was without any further telling. For what could He ſay of himſelf more than this Miracle ſpake: which others repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not He? It told them loudly enough, would they have heard, that he had the power of God in him; one of whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives it is (cxlvi. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.) <hi>to open the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:204181:92"/>eyes of the blind.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt alſo had told them plainly, that <hi>he ſaw the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit deſcending from Heaven, like a Dove, and it abode upon him,</hi> i. 32. Here was an unexceptionable witneſs of the truth of this ſtory, which <hi>John</hi> preſently publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And they had reaſon to believe him, becauſe he that authorized him to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter that Baptiſm, which they received, gave him this for a ſign whereby he ſhould know the Chriſt when he ſaw him; <hi>Upon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending and remaining on him, the ſame is he which bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeth with the Holy Ghoſt. And I ſaw, and bare record, that this is the Son of God, ver.</hi> 33, 34.</p>
                        <p>He could be no leſs, on whom ſuch a Divine Glory, not only deſcended, but alſo <hi>remained</hi> and took up its abode with him. That's the laſt thing to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the chiefeſt of all. He had not a mere glance of this viſible Majeſty, which did not make a tranſient appearance: but he ſaw it <hi>remaining</hi> on him. It ſtaid for ſome time there, as if it intended to make him its habitation and dwelling place. And ſo it did; for as <hi>He</hi> ſaw the viſible Divine majeſty or glory remaining on him then; ſo the thing ſignified by it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:204181:93"/>alway; and made <hi>all</hi> ſee, if they would attend, that he was the Sanctuary or moſt holy Place, in which God was, and had taken up his reſidence for ever. The body of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as I ſaid before, is now become the <hi>Temple of God;</hi> not made by man, but by God himſelf in the Virgins womb. There God manifeſted himſelf perpetually by ſenſible effects, as I ſhall ſhow you preſently; declaring <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be his Son, in whom <hi>the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelt bodily.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After this viſible Majeſty diſappeared, the preſence of God within him was very apparent. For he came away from <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Luke, full of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> iv. 1. And having been tempted a while in the wilderneſs, <hi>he returned</hi> from thence, <hi>in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, ver.</hi> 14. There he taught in his own City, and opened the Book at that very place of <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> where he ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me:</hi> which Scripture was that day fulfilled in their ears, <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 21. And at <hi>Cana,</hi> in that Country he began to work miracles, and <hi>manifeſted forth his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> ii. <hi>John</hi> 11. That is ſhowed indeed that the Divine Majeſty ſpoken of before, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in him. Of which glory they did
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:204181:93"/>not ſee ſo little as a flaſh or two, but <hi>they beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father,</hi> i. 14. He caſt about every where ſuch rays of glory and maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty as declared him to be no leſs perſon than God's <hi>only begotten Son:</hi> and theſe they <hi>beheld,</hi> and were conſtant eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of, to the end of his life. For <hi>he went about doing good, and healing all that were oppreſſed of the Devil; for God was with him,</hi> x. <hi>Acts</hi> 38. This was all his buſineſs, to beſtow benefits upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and to relieve thoſe who were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways helpleſs, but only by a Divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. As was notorious in his frequent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion of Devils, and opening the eyes of him who was blind from his birth; and after that, raiſing <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, in which great work <hi>they ſaw the glory of God,</hi> xi. <hi>John</hi> 40. Who <hi>did not give the Spirit by meaſure to him;</hi> that is, with ſuch reſtriction as he himſelf gave it to his Apoſtles at the firſt: <hi>But the Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands,</hi> as the Baptiſt ſpeaks, iii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 34, 35. <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell,</hi> i. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 19. So that none could have any thing of the Spirit, but from his hands, and he could commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate what he pleaſed. Which is a ſign
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:204181:94"/>that he was the place, where the Divine majeſty and the Holy Spirit now dwelt, and had taken up its reſidence among men; who muſt all repair to him, if they would receive the Holy Ghoſt, or any bleſſing from above.</p>
                        <p>What greater argument could there be, that he was the Son of God, than this, that he had <hi>all things</hi> now <hi>put into his hands,</hi> to do what he pleaſed on <hi>Earth:</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in ſuch a viſible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as a pledge that he ſhould ſhortly have all power in <hi>Heaven</hi> too, at the right hand of God? It was fit that this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt to him ſhould be accompanied with the voice of God, which came out of that or the like cloud, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> So we ſhall have ſtill farther reaſons to acknowledge him, if we do but make theſe following Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon what hath been here diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                        <p>One is, that here was not ſo little as the appearance of an Angel to him, by whom God declared his will to the Prophets: but a far more illuſtrious manifeſtation of the Divine Glory, which came down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:204181:94"/>him and declared him more than a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. <hi>Maimonides</hi> doubts not to ſay
<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>More Nevoch.

And God is ſaid <hi>to dwell</hi> between them, and <hi>to ride</hi> upon them; becauſe all Prophecy was carried by them from God to men. But here is ſomething far beyond this way of communication between God and Men. For not an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel appeared or ſpake unto him: But that Divine Glory which dwelt between the Cherubims, deſcends upon him and makes him its reſting place; and God himſelf ſpeaks to him at the ſame time out of that Glory, calling him his <hi>Son,</hi> and bidding all <hi>hear him.</hi> This was a manifeſt declaration of his high and ſingular prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; and a ſign that no leſs than the <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead</hi> dwelt in him: So that he knew, as I ſaid before, the mind of God, not by Viſions and Dreams, or by mediation of Angels, but by a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate familiarity with God, dwelling and reſiding in him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="164" facs="tcp:204181:95"/>For you may obſerve further (which is another thing very remarkable) that though there had been formerly an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a <hi>Schekinah,</hi> of the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that is, or glory of God, when the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt were imparted to ſome perſons: Yet we never read that this <hi>Schekinah</hi> came down upon any man, much leſs that it remained on him, but upon <hi>Jeſus</hi> only. When the LXX. Elders were to receive a portion of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, God ordered them to be brought unto the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and ſays, he would come down and talk with <hi>Moſes there,</hi> and take of the Spirit which was upon him, and put it upon them, xi. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16, 17. Accordingly you read (<hi>ver.</hi> 24.) that as they ſtood round about the Tabernacle, <hi>the Lord came down in a cloud</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 25.) that is, in ſuch a manner as now the Holy Ghoſt deſcended at our Lord's Baptiſm: But He came not down upon them, who were about the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle; but rather (as in the next ſtory, xii. 5. and at other times) <hi>stood in the door of the Tabernacle;</hi> from whence he ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> and took of the Spirit which was on him, and gave it to the ſeventy Elders. Whereas here the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> came down
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:204181:95"/>in a viſible glory, and pitched upon <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf: who was the Tabernacle now, where God choſe to dwell. For this <hi>Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinah,</hi> as you have heard, or Divine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, not only <hi>lighted</hi> on him, but reſted there and <hi>remained</hi> in him: as if God had told him who ſaw it both deſcend and abide on him; <hi>Here will I dwell for ever, for therein do I delight.</hi> This demonſtrated him to be more than any ever was; not merely a great Prophet, but the very Son of God. Never was there ſuch a Crown prepared for any mans head, but his. Never before did the hand of Heaven put ſuch a Diadem of Glory upon any perſon, as this which encircled, and, as I may ſay, was bound about our Saviour. This can be accounted nothing leſs than the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the HOLY GHOST to him; that he was the <hi>Holy one</hi> of God, the <hi>anointed</hi> from above, the <hi>King</hi> of God's people, and <hi>the heir of all things.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus S. <hi>Peter</hi> you know expreſſes the honour which was now done him, when he tells <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company, x. <hi>Acts</hi> 38. that <hi>God ANOINTED him with the Holy Ghost, and with power.</hi> The HOLY GHOST came down as an holy oil from the Heavenly Sanctuary,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:204181:96"/>which being poured on him, in ſuch a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majeſty, gave him authority to be called the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and made him <hi>his King.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt acknowledged him, you remember, as ſoon as he beheld this ſtrange ſight, <hi>and bare record</hi> of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, that <hi>this perſon</hi> (thus anointed) <hi>was the Son of God,</hi> i. <hi>John</hi> 34. He was now inveſted with a royal power (for that's the meaning of his being ANOIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TED) and we ought, I ſhall ſhow you, to look upon this as a ſolemn inauguration of him in his Kingdom: to which he had now a title given him, together with ſome part of a Kingly Authority. And if there be any truth in the Traditions of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> concerning their own Ceremonies, there was ſomething remarkable in it that this ANOINTING him with the holy oil from above, was immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he came up out of the waters of <hi>Jordan.</hi> For <hi>Maimonides</hi> and the Doctors in the <hi>Talmud</hi> tell us, that they never anointed a King of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> but at the ſide of a Fountain, or of a River of water. Which was the reaſon that <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his ſervants, <hi>to bring his ſon Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon down to GIHON,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> i. 33. and there anoint him King over <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For this GIHON was a little River, as
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:204181:96"/>
                           <hi>R. Solomon</hi> there notes, or the head of a River nigh <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which diſcharged it ſelf into the brook <hi>Kidron,</hi> and in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe is called by the newer name of <hi>Siloah.</hi> It was made very famous afterward by that memorable work of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxxii. 30.) who to take away the advantage any Enemy might make of it in a ſiege, ſtopt up the courſe of its water, and brought it by Chanels under-ground into the City of <hi>David.</hi> At this place without the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not in the City, <hi>Zadok and Nathan anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted King Solomon.</hi> That is, one of them poured out the oil, and the other anointed his head; drawing a circle with the oil upon it. For ſo they all ſay, that Kings were anointed <hi>in the form of a Crown,</hi> to denote the royal dignity. Which if it be true, and that they made choice of ſuch a place to ſhow (as they will have it) the perpetuity of their Kingdom; becauſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers run alway, though the Cities which ſtand by them decay and may be demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: then it is very obſervable that our Lord was ANOINTED or Crowned with the Holy Ghoſt by the River JOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAN, rather than in any other place, to denote him indeed to be the King of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> who ſhould <hi>ſit upon the throne of his
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:204181:97"/>Father David,</hi> as the Angel ſaid, <hi>for ever and ever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this I mention only by the way. The chief thing to be noted is, that now he began to reign, and entred upon his Kingdom, called the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> which <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt told them was at hand. For this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the HOLY GHOST in ſuch a viſible majeſty did not merely give him a title to the Divine Kingdom which was to be erected by him in the world; and aſſured him that he was God's Chriſt, or ANOINTED, that is, <hi>his King;</hi> and endued him with ſuch royal qualities, as fitted him for that office: But it made him a King by conferring ſeveral branches of the Regal power on him, and by giving him authority to exerciſe them in the world. It is true indeed, he did not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally take poſſeſſion of his Kingdom, nor exerciſe his royal power completely, and the time of his inthroning was deferred, till he had accompliſhed the will of God other ways, and <hi>by the ſuffering of death was crowned with glory and honour</hi> in the Heavens. But that he did not act only as a Prophet all his life-time, but likewiſe took upon him the perſon of a King (or
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:204181:97"/>acted as a Royal Prophet) doing many things which only the royal Authority could do, is a moſt manifeſt Truth in the Holy ſtory.</p>
                        <p>Which cannot be better explained than by the parallel caſe of his Father <hi>David,</hi> who was the exact type and figure of him. He was <hi>anointed</hi> by <hi>Samuel</hi> ſome years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſate upon the <hi>throne of the Lord.</hi> But as that <hi>Unction</hi> was the deſignation of him to the royal dignity, and a pawn or pledge of the poſſeſſion of it in due time: ſo ever after he atchieved very great things which ſpoke him to be the perſon deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God for his Kingdom (as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, I told you, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> ix. 8.) and he alſo received ſome portion of it, before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed it all entirely, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> ii. 4.9. v. 3. Juſt thus did our bleſſed Saviour, after he was ANOINTED with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> give ſeveral proofs that he was a <hi>King</hi> (which is the meaning, you have heard, of the word CHRIST) and had received ſome of the power belonging to that high office. For <hi>firſt</hi> he caſt out Devils and cured all diſeaſes, at any time, when he pleaſed, only with his powerful word, and for nothing. Which were Acts of ſuch royal bounty, that he had
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:204181:98"/>reaſon to ſay, xi. <hi>Luke</hi> 20. <hi>If I by the finger of God caſt out Devils, no doubt the KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM of God is come upon you.</hi> And <hi>ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> over and above this, he forgave mens ſins, and remitted their offences, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing many from the puniſhment of them (v. <hi>Luke</hi> 20.) which every one knows is a power wherewith only Kings and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes are inveſted. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> He raiſed a man from the dead, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed him even from the priſon of the grave. Which certainly was the act of a <hi>King;</hi> and of that King who had <hi>power over all fleſh.</hi> So <hi>Martha</hi> her ſelf under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, when ſhe makes it all one, to raiſe the dead, and to be that King whom God promiſed to ſend them. For when our Saviour ſaith to her, <hi>I am the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and the life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>believest thou this?</hi> Her anſwer follows in theſe terms, <hi>Yea, Lord, I believe that thou art the CHRIST the Son of God which ſhould come into the world,</hi> xi. <hi>John</hi> 27. And laſtly, the very preaching the mind of God, and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel of the Kingdom, with ſuch authority as he did, was the part of a King. For ſo he interprets the word <hi>Kingdom,</hi> when he ſtood before <hi>Pilate,</hi> xviii. <hi>John</hi> 37. Where you may learn, that all this is not the mere collection of reaſon, from

For our Lord ſeeming to grant that he had a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> though not of this world, but Heavenly, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour asks him again, <hi>Art thou a KING then?</hi> To which he anſwers him round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Thou ſayest that I am a KING,</hi> i.e. yes, I am; it is as thou ſayeſt. So the reſt of the Evangeliſts report his Anſwer; <hi>Thou ſayest it,</hi> xxvii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. xv. <hi>Mark</hi> 2. xxiii. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. which is as much, in their Language, as to ſay, <hi>it is ſo;</hi> thou haſt ſaid right, <hi>I am a King.</hi> This is <hi>that GOOD CONFESSION which he witneſſed before Pontius Pilate,</hi> which the Apoſtle propounds to <hi>Timothy</hi>'s imitation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 13. He now openly owned, with the danger of his life, that, as mean as he appeared at preſent, he was appointed by God to be his Vicegerent, the King of the world: which he had manifeſted by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral acts of Kingly power ever ſince he was <hi>anointed with the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And he had ſaid the ſame before, when he was brought to anſwer for himſelf in the chief Council of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Where
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:204181:99"/>the High Prieſt asked him, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Art thou the Chriſt, the Son of the Bleſſed? And Jeſus ſaid, I am,</hi> xiv. <hi>Mark</hi> 61, 62. Which words [<hi>I am</hi>] are the plain interpretation of the other phraſes in the reſt of the Evangeliſts, <hi>Thou haſt ſaid,</hi> xxvi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 64. and, <hi>ye ſay that I am,</hi> xxii. <hi>Luke</hi> 70. where you read, <hi>ver.</hi> 71. that hearing this confeſſion, they forbare to produce any more witneſſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him out of his own mouth. That is, they paſſed the ſentence of death upon him, as a counterfeit (ſo they pretended) of that royal Prophet, whom they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come into the world. Under this character they delivered him to <hi>Pilate,</hi> hoping that he would likewiſe condemn him for Treaſon againſt <hi>Caeſar:</hi> whoſe authority they would have him believe our Saviour ſubverted, <hi>by ſaying, He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was CHRIST a King,</hi> xxiii. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. So the whole multitude of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples had a little before proclaimed him (though not ſuch a King as would do <hi>Caeſar</hi> any harm) when they met him at the foot of the Mount of Olives, and with great joy praiſed God for all the mighty works they had ſeen, <hi>ſaying, Bleſſed be the KING that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in Heaven, and glory in the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:204181:99"/>higheſt;</hi> that is, let Heaven proſper his Kingdom, till it be made moſt glorious, xix. <hi>Luke</hi> 38.</p>
                        <p>There needs no more be ſaid to ſhew, that he was made a King, by this Unction of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> though the full poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Kingdom and exerciſe of his whole royal power he did not attain, till he was advanced to his Throne of glory in the Heavens; when he received from the Father the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt to beſtow upon others (ii. <hi>Acts</hi> 33.) and poured it down as an holy Oil on their heads, to create them Miniſters in his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>That was a further witneſs to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as I ſhould now proceed to ſhow you; but that it may be fit, before I part with this, to take notice, that this teſtimony which the HOLY GHOST now gave to him, when it <hi>anointed</hi> him at his Baptiſm, was ſo remarkable, that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> hath not forgot to leave a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it in his <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Where he brings in God ſpeaking after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;

                        <p>But whatſoever <hi>Mahomets</hi> meaning was, when he ſays <hi>God strengthened him with the Holy Ghost,</hi> it is an open acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of that which the Divine wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have recorded; which was ſo famous and notorious, that Infidels could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it.

The beſt knowledge they had was covered and wrapt up in types and figures, till God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Jeſus, and rent thoſe clouds in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:204181:103"/>pieces, by the brightneſs of his beams. They had but ſuch a confuſed apprehenſion of things in former times, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> compares this diſcovery of God in Chriſt, to the breaking forth of light, out of the rude Chaos, in the beginning of the world, 2 Corinth. iv. 6. <hi>For God who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs</hi> (i. Gen. 2, 3.) <hi>hath ſhined in our hearts</hi> (the hearts of the Apoſtles) <hi>to give the light of the knowledge of the GLORY OF GOD, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Some flaſhes of which light and majeſty of God in him, came from his face; not long after he entred into the World. When he was but a Childe, they wondred at his wiſdome; and <hi>were aſtoniſhed at his underſtanding and anſwers,</hi> ii. Luk. 47. But when he was grown up and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon him, like the Glory of the Lord which filled the Tabernacle and Temple; then his Wiſdome appeared the more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly. And was the more amazing; becauſe they knew he was not trained up in the Schools of Learning, nor had any better breeding than a Carpenter's ſhop could give him. For ſo his Countrymen ſay, in S. <hi>Mark,</hi> vi. 2, 3. <hi>Is not this the Carpenter, the Son of Mary? How comes he by theſe things? and what wiſdome is this
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:204181:103"/>which is given unto him?</hi> They were <hi>aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed</hi> at his Doctrine, and as S. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, iv. 22. <hi>Wondred at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Divinity of the matter which he ſpake, and the mighty works which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied it; there was a certain majeſty in the manner of its delivery. For he taught <hi>as one having authority,</hi> vii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 29. That is, as one who had power to enact and ordain new Laws (and thoſe much ſuperiour to the old) and not only to explain thoſe which were already writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. He plainly alſo diſcovered a power to reward the faithful and to puniſh the diſobedient; which was ſo aſtoniſhing, that in the judgment even of thoſe who were ſent to apprehend him, <hi>Never man ſpake like unto him,</hi> vii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 46. He open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them the Kingdom of Heaven; he revealed to them Immortal Life; he gave them Manna, of which if a Man did eat, he aſſured them he ſhould never dye: and he promiſed (which is the thing they chiefly refer to in that ſpeech) that <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believed in him, out of his belly ſhould flow rivers of living water; which he ſpake concerning the ſpirit, which they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on him ſhould receive, v.</hi> 38, 39. When this promiſe was fulfilled, then
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:204181:104"/>that which <hi>Moſes</hi> did but wiſh for, was actually done, <hi>All the Lords people became Prophets.</hi> He made the gifts of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and <hi>wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> as common as ordinary diſcourſe was before. Which ſhowed that indeed God dwelt in him; elſe he could not have had all this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, much leſs communicated ſo much to others.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. But it will not be fit to proſecute theſe things too largely; therefore let us paſs to the conſideration of the <hi>mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God</hi> manifeſted from the place where he was ſaid to dwell; which was an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that he was there. And this you ſhall ſee appeared no leſs in our Saviour, as a token that God dwelt in him, and that he was become his Temple. All their <hi>help</hi> you know of old is ſaid to come <hi>from the Sanctuary,</hi> where God inhabitated, and he is ſaid <hi>to strengthen them out of Sion,</hi> xx. Pſal. 2. Thence the Ark, upon the Cover of which the Divine Glory ſate, is called <hi>The Ark of his strength,</hi> cxxxii. Pſal. 8. Nay, it is often called ſimply by the name of <hi>his strength,</hi> Pſal. lxix. 61. <hi>He delivered his STRENGTH into captivity, and his Glory into the Enemies hand.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> cv. 4. <hi>Seek the Lord and his STRENGTH;</hi>
                           <pb n="183" facs="tcp:204181:104"/>that is, the Lord before the Ark of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, from whence their help and ſuccour came. For whether this went, God was ſaid to go along with them to deliver them. As the Philiſtins themſelves had learnt; who hearing the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had brought the Ark into the Field, began to be afraid and ſaid, <hi>GOD is come into the Camp. Wo be to us: for there hath not been ſuch a thing heretofore,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> iv. 7, 8. That is, we fought with Men hitherto, now with God. And this is the meaning of thoſe words, lxxx. Pſal. 2. <hi>Before E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim, Benjamin and Manaſſeh, stir up thy STRENGTH, and come and ſave us.</hi> Thoſe three Tribes marching immediately after the Ark (for their quarter was on the <hi>Weſt</hi> of the Tabernacle, in which part was the moſt holy place, and the Ark in it, ii. Numb. 17, 18, &amp;c.) it is as much as if he had ſaid, make thy ſelf ſenſibly preſent now to thy People; manifeſt thy favour towards them from thy Mercy ſeat; ſhew that thou art among us, and give us a ſign and token of thy preſence and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by overcoming and treading down our enemies.</p>
                        <p>Now, as then he gave proof that he dwelt there, by thoſe acts of power and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:204181:105"/>might: ſo he made it manifeſt by all the wonderful things which Jeſus did, that he was the Sanctuary wherein he dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. From him there were ſuch emanations of power, as never flowed from the Ark it ſelf. He <hi>stirred up his ſtrength</hi> indeed (that I may borrow the ancient Language) when Jeſus appeared, <hi>and came and ſaved them</hi> in a diviner man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Whenſoever he healed any deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Diſeaſe, it was an act of Salvation and deliverance; which told them there was a gracious preſence of God among them. When he caſt out a Devil; it was the vanquiſhing of a dreadful Enemy. And when he threw out a whole <hi>Legion,</hi> it was a glorious victory over a more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Army, than ever the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by the STRENGTH of God among them, had overcome. To ſay nothing of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Winds and the boiſterous Waves, which as readily obeyed him; as the <hi>red Sea fled when Judah was Gods Sanctuary,</hi> cxiv. Pſal. 2. (the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence not having ſetled it ſelf then among them in any certain place) and <hi>Jordan was driven back</hi> before the Ark of his ſtrength. By theſe acts it plainly appeared that all things were under his Authority; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men and other Creatures here below;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:204181:105"/>but alſo Angels, Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: over whom he as eaſily triumphed, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had heretofore done, by the power of God among them, over the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins, or ſuch like adverſaries. Nay, he gave his Apoſtles ſuch a power over them, that they were ready to triumph too much in theſe conqueſts. He is fain to repreſs the joy wherewith they were tranſported; and to bid them not rejoyce ſo much that the Devils were made ſubject to them, as that they themſelves were become the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his Kingdom, and their Names written in Heaven, x. <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. And ſo eminent was this manifeſtation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power in him, that he did but ſpeak a word, and any thing was done that he required. In ſo much that the People were amazed, to hear him only ſay to a Devil, <hi>Come out,</hi> and inſtantly he left the Man and hurt him not. <hi>What a word is this? for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean ſpirits, and they come out,</hi> iv. Luk. 37. And upon another occaſion of the like nature, you read the ſame again, that <hi>They were all amazed at the mighty power of God,</hi> ix. 43. And acknowledged with juſt admiration at ſuch another ſight, that, <hi>It was never ſo ſeen in Iſrael,</hi> ix. Matth. 33. Among all the marvellous works of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:204181:106"/>times, even thoſe done by <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when the Divine Glory viſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on ſeveral occaſions to them, there never was any thing like to that which our Saviour now wrought; ſo quickly, without ſo much as the pains of a bare touch, by his Word only, and in all ſorts of Diſeaſes, none excepted.

                        <p>The ground of all which was, that theſe were ſeparated by Gods ſpecial command for his uſes and ſervice alone. And the Tabernacle was built by peculiar directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he himſelf gave, and by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine art and skill, wherewith the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were inſpired, and no other. And juſt thus was the Temple of our Saviour's Body likewiſe ſet apart and ſeparated from all common fleſh, to be the dwelling place
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:204181:108"/>of God. Man had no hand in the making of it; but it was formed in the Womb of a pure Virgin by the power of the Holy Ghoſt. Upon which ſcore, the Angel calls him before he was conceived, <gap reason="foreign">

For he was again ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from all other by a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and by the anointing of the Holy Ghoſt, and by many other things not now to be mentioned, which declared him to be the <hi>MOST HOLY</hi> or <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet, ix. 24. which <hi>Abenezra</hi> expounds to be meant of <hi>Christ.</hi> And the unſpotted Holineſs that was both in his Doctrine and in his life (as you ſhall hear afterward) and the innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and purity likewiſe of his followers and attendants, were no ſmall Teſtimony add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the reſt, that God was in him. <hi>For he did no ſin,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> And all they that <hi>came to him</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 4, 5.) <hi>as unto a living stone,</hi> or Temple, <hi>rejected indeed of men, but cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of God and precious,</hi>

                        <p n="5">V. Let us briefly obſerve how the <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience</hi> of God which appeared in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour declared that He dwelt in him, as the punctual prediction of many things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declared his preſence at the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. There <hi>Moſes</hi> you know made his enquiries upon all occaſions. And from thence in after Ages God gave them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers concerning things unknown; when the High-Prieſt ſtood before the moſt holy place, with the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> on his breaſt. And therefore that the World might ſee God had chang'd his Seat, and now dwelt here, in his Holy Child <hi>Jeſus,</hi> He declared things ſecret; and not onely foretold a number of things, both concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelf and others, but manifeſted that he knew even the thoughts and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of Mens hearts, ii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 23, 24. And underſtood what was done at a diſtance from him, i. <hi>Joh.</hi> 47, 48. Which was ſo demonſtrative a proof to the true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> of the preſence of God in him; that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:204181:109"/>he cries out, <hi>Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Iſrael.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the manner of his <hi>knowing what was in man</hi> and all other things, was the moſt admirable. For whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> was fain ſtill to repair to one place, and inquire at the Mercy ſeat, before he could tell the mind of God: And could not ſo much as reſolve a difficult caſe about the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Law, till he went to hear what the Lord would command concerning the perſons who were in doubt, ix. <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. Our Lord had no need at all to go any whither to make ſuch enquiries; but in every place, even in <hi>Samaria,</hi> knew the greateſt ſecrets, iv. <hi>Joh.</hi> 18, 19. For he himſelf was the Tabernacle of God. He was the Tent which God had pitched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men: ſeparated unto him, as the Tabernacle and Temple were, by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible deſcent of the Divine Glory upon him, and by its reſiding in him. So that whereſoever he was, he had an Oracle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually within himſelf: and without any addreſſes to the moſt Holy place, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; knew all things, and revealed the mind of God to Men. And all this was ſo conſpicuous, that it was far better known than the preſence of the Lord upon the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:204181:109"/>Ark. For that was confined to one place, whereas <hi>Jeſus went about doing good.</hi> Which may be the meaning of that famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, iii. <hi>Jer.</hi> 16, 17. Where he ſays, <hi>they ſhould not make mention of the Ark any more;</hi> that is, worſhip God before that, as the only place; But <hi>Jeruſalem ſhould be the THRONE OF THE LORD;</hi> to which all Nations ſhould be gathered: that is, in every part of the City (and Country too) he would appear as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, as he had done formerly in the moſt holy place of the Temple, which could be at no other time, but when Jeſus appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them, and ſent (by his Apoſtles) <hi>the Law out of Zion, and the Word of the Lord from Jeruſalem,</hi> to all Nations. ii. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3, 4. The THRONE OF THE LORD, I have told you already, is in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> teaches us, <hi>Every place which God ſeparates for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Divine glory.</hi> So the Heaven is called <hi>his Throne,</hi> lxvi. Iſa. 1. And by that name <hi>Jeremiah</hi> calls their Sanctuary, xvii. Jer. 12. <hi>A glorious high Throne from the beginning, is the place of our Sanctuary.</hi> And ſo I told you the <hi>Ark</hi> is called; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that was the peculiar place in the Sanctuary where he reſided. But at laſt you ſee all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (by which we may
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:204181:110"/>underſtand the whole Nation) was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>THRONE of the LORD.</hi> As it did when Jeſus appeared (who in perſon was ſent to that Nation alone) in whom the Divine glory ſhone illuſtriouſly in all places, whereſoever he came. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Wiſdome, the Power, the Love of God in him; not only in the Temple, where he oft appeared, but in every part of the holy City. In the ſtreets, nay in the high wayes, in the fields, in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, upon the ſea, there was a moſt glorious appearance of God; ſuch as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was when the Ark alone was the <hi>THRONE of the LORD.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Which puts me in mind, and then I ſhall end this; that the <hi>Unity</hi> of God is as much, nay more, diſcovered in our bleſſed Saviour, as it was at the Tabernacle or Temple in former times. As there was but <hi>one place</hi> where. God put his Name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and they were all to go to the very ſame <hi>Oracle;</hi> whereby they were preſerved in the belief and worſhip of <hi>one</hi> God: So now God hath manifeſted that this is his ONLY begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son; and that there is no name given under Heaven whereby we can be ſaved, but only His; and that we muſt ſeek to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:204181:110"/>no other Mediator, but this <hi>One;</hi> in whom now God appears in ſuch a glory, as he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any where elſe. And this is alſo to keep us in the belief that God is one: which may hence alſo appear by this <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of God in the fleſh.</hi> For whereas we call God by ſeveral attributes, the moſt holy, the moſt wiſe, the moſt powerful, and the like; yet we ſee all theſe were in one perſon Chriſt Jeſus. Which may well inſtruct us, that they all together are but One God; and that it is one eternal Majeſty, who is ſo holy, wiſe, powerful and good.</p>
                        <p>But, as I ſaid, this was better made known by our Saviour, than by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty reſiding at the Temple. For during all the time that the Holy Oracle of God ſtood at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> there were alſo Oracles, which pretended gods main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained among the Gentiles. This upheld the Opinion concerning a multitude of gods: And all that <hi>Moſes</hi> or the Prophets could do, did not deſtroy this belief in the World; no, not root it out of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> till God appeared in our Lord and Saviour. Then theſe other Oracles grew mute; and it was held ridiculous to believe any more Gods than One. The Devils loſt all their

Aeſculapius and the reſt of the Gods have withdrawn themſelves from men, and do not converſe with them.</hi> From whence <hi>Euſebius</hi> argues very rationally on this manner. How come you to know, thoſe whom you worſhip, to be gods? Why did not <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> and the reſt of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions overthrow the power of Jeſus, and make it of none effect? If he be a mortal Man, as you ſay (nay, perhaps you call him a jugler and a deceiver) and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be Saviours and gods; What is the matter that they flee before him, and turn their backs of one that is ſo inconſiderable? Why do they yield up all the World to his power; and abandon all their ſubjects, in this ſhameful manner? If you have any ſence, you muſt conclude, that he is ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than they; and that what he ſpeaks is true. For though he be but one, and as, one would ſuppoſe, alone; yet He hath
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:204181:111"/>driven away a vaſt number of gods, and made them leave the World. He hath aboliſhed their worſhip and ſervice, and expoſed them to ſuch contempt; that as they appear no longer gods, ſo they can do juſt nothing. They are not able ſo much as to ſhow themſelves, as they were wont, to their followers: But plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that they were <hi>Daemons,</hi> not <hi>Gods.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But on the contrary the worſhip of this JESUS, and that ONE GOD, who, he ſaith, ſent him into the World, is every day more and more propagated; and takes deeper root in the minds of all People. One would have thought that theſe gods, ſhould have beſtirred themſelves at his coming, more than ever. They ſhould have made combinations, and joyned all their forces againſt him. Their Oracles which were ſo famous, ſhould now, above all other times, have been frequented; and ſpoken moſt loudly, ſo that all the World might hear them, againſt this perſon, who came to deſtroy that Religion, and take away all that reverence which was paid them. Or if one Oracle had been dumb upon any particular cauſe; yet all of them together, one would think, ſhould not have loſt their voice and their credit,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:204181:112"/>in this faſhion. Theſe gods ſhould have had more care of their reputation, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; than to let this ſingle perſon, whom they pretended alſo to be ſo mean, to prevail thus mightily againſt them. For as <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, in thoſe very places where there was in times paſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, a <hi>great glory of the Divinity;</hi> there was nothing to do in his days, but all was vaniſht. A ſign that indeed God was more in our Saviour, than he ever had been in any other perſon or place; and that he was no where elſe; and that he would be worſhipped only in that way, which he taught and preſcribed. For they ſaw his GLORY, the GLORY as OF THE ONLY BEGOTTEN Son, (i. Joh. 14.) who had thoſe marks of a Divine Majeſty reſiding in him, that none ever had; and from whom we may expect all that the wiſdom, power, and love of God can do for us.</p>
                        <p>What ſhould we do then, but after ſuch evident proofs that God is in him; fall down, and with the moſt humble and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reverence worſhip him, who, as it there follows, is <hi>full of grace and truth?</hi> Becauſe he is full of TRUTH we ought to reſign and ſubmit our ſelves to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:204181:112"/>and becauſe he is full of GRACE we ſhould always rejoyce to think that we are under his care, and we ſhould put our truſt under the ſhaddow of his wings. And that he is ſo full of both, that we may with great ſatisfaction commit our ſelves to his guidance, confide and rejoyce in him; will appear ſtill more evidently by the next Teſtimony which he received from the HOLY GHOST.</p>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:204181:114"/>they were very diſconſolate; and <hi>ſorrow filled their heart.</hi> Whereupon he chears them up with this aſſurance that he would not leave them comfortleſs, like ſo many fatherleſs Children, but <hi>pray the Father, and he would give them another Comforter, who ſhould abide with them for ever;</hi> and never go away from them, as he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to do, xiv. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. This he tells them was the <hi>ſpirit of truth,</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>whom the Father would ſend in his Name,</hi> verſ. 26. where he repeats this over again, and tells them what the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> would do for them. And therefore charges them not to be troubled or afraid, but rather rejoyce to hear him ſay he was going to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>who was Greater than he;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would give him power, when he went to him, to do more for them, than he could do now, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. And then he adds the reaſon why he ſaid all this, verſ. 29. <hi>Now I have told you before it come to paſs; that when it is come to paſs, you might believe.</hi> That is, be confirmed in the belief of all that I have ſaid, and fully perſwaded I have not boaſted of a power and authority, which doth not belong to me. They might well be confident of it themſelves, and bid <hi>all the Houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly that God had made the ſame. Jeſus whom they
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:204181:114"/>crucified, both Lord and Chriſt;</hi> when they ſaw this come to paſs, which he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told and promiſed ſo often: Before his Death, xv. <hi>Joh.</hi> 26, 27. xvi. 7. After his Reſurrection, xxiv. <hi>Luke</hi> 49. Juſt before his Aſcenſion, i. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.8. Where he bids them not ſtir from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but <hi>wait for the promiſe of the Father, which they had heard of him,</hi> and which would give them Power to be his Witneſſes every where.</p>
                        <p>It was an evident argument, when they received it, of theſe two Divine Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Him; <hi>Foreknowledge,</hi> and <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</hi> They had reaſon to believe there was a Divine Majeſty in him, when he was with them on Earth; and to truſt to all he had ſaid either of himſelf, or them, or thoſe that ſhould believe on his Name; and to look upon Him now as the King of Glory, with all power in Heaven and Earth. For how could he have taken the boldneſs to foretell and promiſe ſuch a thing as this from God the Father, what hope had he to make it good; if he had not been ſure that <hi>the Father and He were one;</hi> (as he ſpeaks <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. of that xiv. <hi>Joh.</hi>) and that what He ſaid was by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who would juſtifie his word? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:204181:115"/>could have been more vain, or done him greater diſcredit after all the glory he had got, than to give this as a ſign of his truth; if he himſelf had not been ſure that <hi>God had given all things into his hand, and that he came out from God, and was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God,</hi> as it is xiii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. And what greater argument could there be, that he did not aſſume a Dignity or Title, which he had no right unto; than the verifying his word in ſo hard and difficult a caſe as this, even then when his Enemies thought he could do nothing, becauſe he was dead and buried? This muſt needs make the Apoſtles as ſure as he was; (for his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent belief could not work belief in them) and therefore He did fulfil his promiſe; and indued them with ſuch power from on high, that in a moment He brought all things which he had taught them to their remembrance; enabled them to ſpeak with all manner of Tongues, to make a Man whole with ſpeaking a word, nay to raiſe the Dead, and to give the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> likewiſe to others who believed their word.</p>
                        <p>How came He by this power, if indeed He was not the Lord of all? Why did nor his Word dye with Himſelf and fall to the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:204181:115"/>ground, if he uſurped upon the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of God, and laid claim to a glory which was none of his? How could it come into any Mans mind, let me ask again, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſuch a thing as this; if he did not know what he could do? And could any man do ſuch a thing, if he were not more than a man; even the King of infinite power at the right hand of God? So the Apoſtles could not but conclude when they felt the effects of his royal power in their own hearts; and when they could make others feel them, by innumerable benefits which they beſtowed, both on their Souls and Bodies. To be able to do ſuch things on Earth as he had done, ſhewed plainly what He was: but to be able to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do more wonderful things, when He had left the World; was ſtill a more convincing Argument, that all things were put in ſubjection under his Feet. Nothing now was more evident to them than this great Truth; whatſoever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of it they might have before. With this mighty Inſpiration all their doubts were blown away, like the Duſt before the Wind. This fire which appeared on their Heads, purged their Souls quite from all the reliques of Infidelity; if there were any remaining. They could do nothing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:204181:116"/>now but ſpeak the praiſes of Jeſus, and proclaim Him with theſe Tongues to all the world to be the Lord; with a zeal as hot as fire.</p>
                        <p>The People indeed, it may be ſaid, did not hear him foretell this glorious day, and make any ſuch promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore how could it convince them? I anſwer, it is confeſſed that He did not ſpeak of this ſo plainly to them, as He did to the Apoſtles; and therefore I have not alledged it all this time for that purpoſe: but only to ſhow that they to whom he ſo often gave hopes of the coming of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt upon them, had reaſon to rely upon its Teſtimony when it came; even upon this account, that it was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his gracious promiſe to them. There are many proofs which we produce, ſeem to carry leſs force in them than really they have; when careleſs minds ſtretch them too far, to prove more than was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The <hi>Jews</hi> were to be convinced by it upon another ſcore, not by the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his particular promiſes to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; which could work no further upon the People, than they believed their teſtimony who came with ſuch power from Jeſus to them. But I muſt add
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:204181:116"/>alſo, that our Saviour had ſaid ſomething of this to all the people at a publick Feaſt, vii. <hi>John</hi> 38, 39. And when he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned he openly declared to the High Prieſt and the whole Senate, that they ſhould preſently receive ſenſible tokens of his Majeſty, which now they ſo affronted. For when they adjured him to tell them whether he was <hi>the Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> xxvi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 63. though he knew they would neither believe him, if he told them, nor give him a good reaſon, if he argued with them, why they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (xxii. <hi>Luke</hi> 67, 68.) yet he told them in expreſs terms, that he was, <hi>ver.</hi> 64. And then adds theſe remarkable words; <hi>Nevertheleſs, I ſay unto you</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> though now you do not believe what I have told you, yet mind what I ſay) <hi>hereafter</hi> (from this moment, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, xxii. <hi>Luke</hi> 69. or very few days hence) <hi>you ſhall ſee the Son of man ſitting on the right hand of power.</hi> Which can refer to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, which preſently enſued, and was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain argument that he was at God's right hand, ii. <hi>Acts</hi> 33. When this came they could not but <hi>ſee,</hi> unleſs they would be wilfully blind, that he was poſſeſſed of the Kingdom, he had ſo much ſpoken of.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:204181:117"/>It was an irrefragable teſtimony that he was the Son of the Bleſſed, and could the leſs be gain ſaid, becauſe he told them before-hand they ſhould <hi>ſee</hi> what they would not then <hi>believe.</hi> That is, have a manifeſt demonſtration of his glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in the Heavens. Which if it would not move them, nothing remained but to <hi>ſee him,</hi> after another faſhion, <hi>coming in the clouds of Heaven,</hi> as it there follows. To deſtroy, that is, ſuch incredulous wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, who killed their King, and perſiſted ſo obſtinately in their rebellion, that they <hi>reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> whom he ſent to convince them of their crime, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them to his obedience. So it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, xxii. <hi>Luke</hi> 27, 31.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. For the power of it was ſo great, that ſetting aſide this conſideration, if he had ſaid nothing at all to them or his Apoſtles of his ſending the Holy Ghoſt; yet its coming in this manner, was an evident teſtimony both to them and all others, that he made a juſt claim to be their King. He could not elſe have ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſuch royal gifts ſo bountifully among them, as the manner of Emperors was in their Triumphs, and of Kings at their Coronation. This ſhowed that indeed he
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:204181:117"/>had the power, which the <hi>Jews</hi> denied him. It vindicated his rights, which they would have taken from him. It made it appear, he was what he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and that not <hi>He,</hi> but <hi>they</hi> were the guilty perſons; who had condemned him, for ſaying, he was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> This was the very end of its coming, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour alſo told his Apoſtles a little before his death, xvi. <hi>John</hi> 7, 8, 9. where He ſaith, that if he went away he would ſend the PARACLETE, that is, his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> unto them; whoſe office it ſhould be, to <hi>convince the World of Sin, of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and of Judgment.</hi> Of this place I ſhall be able, I hope, to give a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count hereafter, together with all thoſe that relate to the Holy Ghoſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall ſay no more of it now than this: That the end of the PARACLETE'S coming was to plead the Cauſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; to maintain his innocence; and to prove againſt all accuſers, that though he was condemned by men, yet he was acquitted by God, and had ſaid nothing but the truth.</p>
                        <p>For obſerve but the crime whereof he was accuſed, and for which he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and you will ſoon ſee
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:204181:118"/>that nothing could clear him ſo much as this. The great thing they laid to his charge, as you have heard already, was that he affirmed, when they adjured him to ſpeak his thought, that he was <hi>the Chriſt the Son of the Bleſſed.</hi> This was the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, which they pretended wounded their hearts with grief when they heard it, and for which they adjudged him to be worthy of death. Now what could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the vileneſs of this calumny, and prove him not guilty, more than ſuch a power poſſeſſing his followers even after he was dead, as they ſaw in himſelf when he was alive? Nay, a far greater, which declared, as they truly ſaid, that he was <hi>Lord of all?</hi> x. <hi>Acts</hi> 36. He could not have done ſuch things, as they beheld were wrought at the invoking of his Name, if he were not truly the <hi>Son of God.</hi> The Apoſtles might have called long enough upon him, before they had made a man lame from his Mother's womb, walk up and down and leap and praiſe God; if he whom they crucified, were not exalted by God's right hand, to be a <hi>Prince and a Saviour.</hi> And it had been the vaineſt thing of all, for the Apoſtles to go and preach up the authority of a dead man, and who was ignominiouſly crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:204181:118"/>as a great Malefactor; if they had not known that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> from him was ready at hand in every place and time, to be his ADVOCATE, and take his part againſt all gain-ſayers.</p>
                        <p>This Heavenly <hi>Witneſs</hi> never failed to appear when there was need of him, to juſtifie our Saviour, and to ſet all things right in the opinion of the World; by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing their falſe judgment, and by eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing and verifying the ſentence he had paſſed on himſelf; when he ſaid that he was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> The Tables were now turned by the appearance of this PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACLETE, who pleaded ſo ſtrongly and convincingly, that many who had before accounted him an evil doer, were now forced to alter their mind and confeſs him to be a righteous perſon. They who had reviled him, now gave him worſhip and honour. They that cried Crucifie him, ſaid as the Centurion, when they heard the HOLY GHOST ſpeak on his behalf, <hi>Sure this was the Son of God.</hi> And all thoſe who were ſo hardy as to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (vii. <hi>Acts</hi> 51.) were fain to oppoſe it with rage and throwing ſtones; for in any other manner they were not able <hi>to reſiſt the wiſdom and the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:204181:119"/>ſpirit,</hi> whereby S. <hi>Steven</hi> (a man <hi>full of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>) ſpake to them and reaſoned with them, vi. <hi>Acts</hi> 9, 10.</p>
                        <p>So great a teſtimony was this of the HOLY GHOST to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that the Apoſtles were not fit to be his <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> till they had received it, xxiv. <hi>Luke</hi> 48. i. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. But after it came upon them and joyned its teſtimony with theirs, then they defended his cauſe ſo ſucceſsfully, that <hi>a great company of the Prieſts,</hi> the greateſt enemies to it, yielded themſelves and became <hi>obedient to the faith,</hi> vi. <hi>Acts</hi> 7. Then if any one asked, how dare you contradict the ſentence of the High Court, to which all men are bound upon pain of death to ſubmit (xvii. <hi>Deut.</hi> 9, 12.) what can you ſay to juſtifie this preſumption, in maintaining his Righteouſneſs, whom the Grand Council of the Nation hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to ſuffer death? They could ſoon make this reply, Let the HOLY GHOST anſwer you; hear what he ſays to you: If He do not ſpeak enough for us and for <hi>Jeſus</hi> to ſatisfie you, then we refuſe not to die; you may deal with us as the deſpiſers of God and his Law. And ſo mightily were they aſtoniſhed and perplexed by the pleadings of the HOLY
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:204181:119"/>GHOST, that the Sanhedrim (the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Court of Judicature among them) knew not what to ſay to the Apoſtles, nor what to do with them. They only clapt them in priſon for preaching <hi>Jeſus</hi> (iv. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.) and threatned farther ſeverity if they did not deſiſt (<hi>ver.</hi> 21.) but they durſt not proceed to paſs the ſentence of death upon them, according as the Law direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the people glorifying God ſo heartily for what they ſaw them do by the power of the Holy Ghoſt. Nay, ſo much were ſome of this great Council ſtaggered, that according to the perſwaſion of <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel,</hi> a great Maſter among them, they let the Apoſtles go free, after a ſecond impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, leſt <hi>perhaps they ſhould be found fighters againſt God, ver.</hi> 39. If this be an humane project, ſays that wiſe man, do not trouble your ſelves about it; for it will come to naught, as the vain attempts of others have done, who at the firſt drew much people after them. But if theſe men prove to be authorized by God, and he will have it ſo; who can overthrow it? We had beſt take heed how we proceed in a buſineſs, wherein we may chance to have God againſt us. It is better in my judgment to be quiet, and ſee what the iſſue will be, leſt in ſtead of contending
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:204181:120"/>with men, we be found to oppoſe God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty himſelf.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. And the iſſue was this (which is the laſt thing) that by the power of this <hi>Advocate</hi> alone, and no other, our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> actually obtained a Kingdom in ſpite of all the oppoſition that could be made againſt him. This was the greateſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to him, which effectually proved him to be a King, by winning him a Kingdom; and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men to ſubmit unto him, though he was inviſible, and not like to reward their ſervices in this World at all, but only in another. It proclaimed him all abroad in the World to be the Lord of life and glory, and by the mere <hi>preaching of the Goſpel with the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from Heaven</hi> (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 1 i. 12.) the Nations were ſubdued to him and acknowledged him for their Sovereign.</p>
                        <p>The High Prieſt and Council of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> as it there follows in v. <hi>Acts</hi> 40. deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to diſcourage the Apoſtles in this preaching, ordered them to be beaten, and then commanded them to ſpeak no more in the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> for fear of a worſe puniſhment that might follow.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:204181:120"/>Alas! vain men, that thought to choak this Truth, and bury this report concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Did they think it was in their power to murder his Name, as they had done Him? and by ſuch means as theſe prevent his Faith from ſpreading it ſelf any further? They were mightily miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the courage of theſe <hi>Twelve men,</hi> who <hi>rejoyced that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his Name:</hi> and as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned</hi> and <hi>ignorant</hi> as they found them (iv. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.) not only perſwaded many in that Country to believe <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the Lord, but carried the fame of him to all Nations. For they received another kind of <hi>Mandate</hi> from him, which they were reſolved to obey; nothing doubting but the power of the Holy Ghoſt would go along with them to proſper their attempt. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rulers ſaid, <hi>Speak not at all, nor teach in the name of Jeſus,</hi> iv. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. But <hi>Jeſus</hi> their Maſter had ſaid, <hi>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> xvi. <hi>Mark</hi> 15. Or as it is in S. <hi>Matthew</hi> xxviii. 19, 20. <hi>Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi> They durſt not therefore but go, eſpecially when
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:204181:121"/>the power of the Holy Ghoſt came down upon them on purpoſe, that they might be able to ſpeak in his name, and win him ſubjects in all the world, by proving that he was perfectly <hi>Lord and Chriſt.</hi> And ſo you read in S. <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 47.48, 49. <hi>It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved Chriſt to die and riſe again, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and forgiveneſs of ſins ſhould be preached in his name among all Nations. And ye are witneſſes of theſe things. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I ſend you the promiſe of my Father: but tarry ye at Jeruſalem</hi> (that is, before you go about this buſineſs) <hi>until ye be indued with power from on high.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now here do but conſider with me, theſe <hi>three</hi> things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the vaſtneſs of this deſign; <hi>Secondly,</hi> the poorneſs of the means; and <hi>thirdly,</hi> the weakneſs and ineptitude of the Inſtruments which were to be imployed by him: and you will ſoon ſee what ſervice the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> did him; without whoſe power he would never have attempted ſuch things, or never have atchieved them. They are all in that place now mentioned, xxviii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>Go and teach all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. See here what a compaſs he takes for his Kingdom, no leſs than all the World. Wherein he intends to ſettle new Laws, and advance
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:204181:121"/>a government proper to himſelf, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a Doctrine not at all taking with fleſh and bloud. Who is there that ever went about any ſuch thing, or had ſuch a thought in his mind? not only to conquer, but to change the Religion of all the world, and aboliſh thoſe Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms which had ſtood for ſo many Ages? What Arms or Ammunition did he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them withal for this purpoſe? With what forces did he ſend them? Or by what means did he hope to win Kings and Princes to reſign their Crowns to him, and ſubmit themſelves to his Orders?</p>
                        <p>Behold, here a new wonder, which is the ſecond thing I now named: He bid them go and PREACH. How could any one fancy he ſhould overcome Nations with his breath? Could he take words to have ſuch force in them, as to perſwade whole Countries that never ſaw him to become his ſubjects? What ſtrange Orators muſt theſe be, who could draw men of ſuch different languages, natures and inclinations, in all the world after them? Where were they bred to learn ſuch powerful Rhetorick, as ſhould charm the hearts of all that heard them? From what School did they come, or by whom
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:204181:122"/>were they inſtructed in the art of catching Souls? Alas! they were very illiterate and ignorant men, Fiſhermen and ſuch like ruſtick people, whom Chriſt called to be Fiſhers for Souls, and ſent to draw hearts to him. And I remember, <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Phaedrus,</hi> when he would expreſs a block, a rude and unbred fellow, ſays he was <gap reason="foreign">

They were the moſt unfit men that could be choſen to be his Embaſſadors; if he had not been ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Lord and Maſter, and they had not gone with other kind of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than the world had known before.</p>
                        <p>And that is the <hi>third</hi> wonder, enough to aſtoniſh any conſidering man, that they who, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> notes, could ſcarce ſpeak their own language well, but were mockt for <hi>Galileans,</hi> whoſe dialect was the moſt broad and ungentile of all the Nation; that theſe, I ſay, ſhould go to ſpeak to all the Nations of the World, with hope to perſwade them. Alas! they were not fit to be Maſters to ſo much as one ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:204181:122"/>much leſs to teach a Country School; how then could they undertake to teach the whole World? What King, what Law-giver, what Philoſopher, either <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Barbarian,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Euſebius</hi> proceeds

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:204181:123"/>nothing. They will take us for a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of fools, and we ſhall look like mere ſtatues and images of men. Or if we could ſpeak their languages, what hope have we to prevail with them? Who will be perſwaded by ſuch as we, to forſake the Religion of their Countrie, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thine who art a ſtranger to them? Truly this had been but a rational queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if our Saviour had not taken care to prevent it, by adding thoſe words to his <hi>Mandate; Lo, I am with you alway to the end of the world.</hi> He had ſaid a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>All power in Heaven and Earth is given to me.</hi> Go therefore and teach all Nations; advance my authority, and ſpread my Kingdom; and do not doubt but you ſhall effect the buſineſs; for I who have all power will be with you. And ſo he was, by the power of the Holy Ghoſt who was his <hi>Advocate;</hi> for he gave them, preſently after, the gift of tongues; he accompanied them every where, if they did but mention his Name, with ſigns and miracles; yea the very ſhadow of ſome of them did more than all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Medicines. This was a very great demonſtration of his ſupreme dominion over all Creatures. Nothing could be more effectual to induce men to obey him,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:204181:123"/>to whom they ſaw every thing elſe was ſubject. Without this they could never have moved men to believe that he was the Lord; but this gave it ſufficient cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</p>
                        <p>For ſuppoſe they had ſtood up in the places of popular concourſe, and ſaid, We come to preach to you in the name of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and require you to ſubmit your ſelves to him, whom God hath made the <hi>Lord of all.</hi> He was born of the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> a great King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> did many wonders in that Nation, though he was hated and rejected by them, and delivered to <hi>Pontius Pilate;</hi> by whom he was crucified; but God raiſed him out of his grave, and we ſaw him go to Heaven, where he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned in the moſt glorious Majeſty, and reigns over all Angels, as well as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Caſt away therefore your ancient Gods, who are his ſubjects. Forſake pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently all your ſuperſtitious Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. Believe on this perſon; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his government, and obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Though you get nothing in this world by it, but perhaps may loſe all you have; he will reward you for it in his Pleavenly Kingdom. What force do you think there would have been in ſuch a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:204181:124"/>ſpeech, to perſwade the Nations far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to fall down before him as their Sovereign? Would they not have ſmiled and ſaid, What do theſe bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers mean to bring us theſe ſtrange ſtories from a foreign land? Why ſhould <hi>we</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be our King, whom his own Country-men would not ſuffer to reign over them? Shall we become the ſubjects of one whom we never ſaw, nor heard of until now? and venture the loſs of all our liberties, and perchance of our lives, for one whom they confeſs to be crucified and dead? What likelihood is there, that he ſhould riſe again from the dead, who could not keep himſelf, when he was alive, from being put to death?</p>
                        <p>Truly, ſaith <hi>Euſebius,</hi> when I conſider the mere doctrine they were to preach, I cannot ſee how they could hope to draw the people to their belief. But then when I conſider how they did prevail every where, at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> in all other places; I muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to a Divine power, which ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Doctrine. <hi>Jeſus</hi> plainly declared by putting them upon the attempt, that he was confident he had all power to get himſelf a Kingdom by this preaching.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:204181:124"/>And by the iſſue it appeared that it was no preſumption wherewith he was poſſeſſed, inſtead of a well grounded confidence. They preached, as he bad them; but it was not with ſuch Rhetorick, as is in uſe among us: not <hi>with the enticing words of mans wiſdom,</hi> with eloquent expreſſions, enchanting language, or mere plauſible arguments; but <hi>in the demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 4. The HOLY GHOST from Heaven pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently appeared whereſoever they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to juſtifie their words, and to teſtifie, by many miraculous operations, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> was no leſs than they affirmed. This evident demonſtration perſwaded mens minds. This was ſuch a power, that the people were ready to take <hi>them</hi> for Gods; and imagined that <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> were come down from Heaven to them: and thereupon prepared publick ſacrifices, to be offered in their honour, xiv. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. Natural reaſon told them that ſuch things could not be done by mortal nature; but they muſt be concluded to be the works of ſome God, though no body told them that they were. And therefore this was all they had to do, for their own ſatisfaction, to enquire by what power and authority the Apoſtles did theſe wonders, ſince they
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:204181:125"/>themſelves confeſſed that they were but men. And here now they took occaſion to let them know, that it was <hi>Jeſus</hi> who did theſe Miracles. Him they preached; and him they hereby proved to be the Lords ANOINTED; who by this power would prevail, notwithſtanding the fierce oppoſition that was made againſt his authority.</p>
                        <p>For, as you read in a devout addreſs which the whole company of believers made to God, <hi>the Rulers were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the Kings of the Earth stood up againſt the Lord and againſt his Chriſt.</hi> At their firſt entrance upon this work, there were mighty endeavours to overthrow it; juſt as there had been againſt his holy child <hi>Jeſus, whom he had ANOINTED,</hi> that is, promoted to a greater glory than he had on Earth. And therefore they deſire God to go along with them, and <hi>stretch forth his hand to heal; and that ſigns and wonders might be done by the name of his holy child Jeſus;</hi> for the propagating of this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which it was not in their own power to advance, iv. <hi>Acts</hi> 26, 27, 30. Now this was a further teſtimony of the power and glory of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that when a ſolemn addreſs was made to God, and they repreſented to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:204181:125"/>him their deſign; they were ſo far from receiving any diſcountenance from him, that he incouraged and promoted this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. For the place where they prayed <hi>was ſhaken,</hi> by a powerful inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which came upon them all, as it had done upon the Apoſtles: <hi>And they were ALL filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and they ſpake the word of God with boldneſs,</hi> ver. 31.</p>
                     </div>

                        <p>And this leads me to the laſt Teſtimony which the HOLY GHOST gave to him, by deſcending upon other perſons as well as upon the Apoſtles; though not in ſuch a viſible form as it did on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> The place indeed was SHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KEN where theſe believers were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, by the like <hi>mighty wind</hi> I ſuppoſe as filled the houſe where the Apoſtles recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ii. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. But there were no fiery tongues now appeared, as there did then: Nor do we afterwards read of any ſuch ſenſible ſign of an inviſible power coming upon them, as this <hi>ſhaking</hi> of the place was, when the Holy Ghoſt firſt deſcended upon the body of the Church. But whenſoever the Apoſtles laid their hands upon any perſon who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:204181:126"/>in <hi>Jeſus</hi> and was baptized; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> fell down upon them, and they ſpake with tongues and propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, viii. <hi>Acts</hi> 15, 17. xix. 6. This <hi>laying on of their hands,</hi> was ever after the only external ſign of the Divine power (for that's the meaning of <hi>stretching out the hand,</hi> in the place juſt before named, iv. <hi>Acts</hi> 30.) wherewith they ſhould be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the requeſt of the Apoſtles. Which was a plain demonſtration of the royal Majeſty and munificence of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whoſe Servants and Miniſters theſe were: and hereby the HOLY GHOST bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to him, that he was the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So this very Apoſtle teaches us in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Chapter of this Epiſtle, where he tells them to whom he writes, that he need not be very ſolicitous to preſcribe them Antidotes againſt thoſe Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doctrines, which then began to poiſon the Church: becauſe they had <hi>an Unction from the holy One, and knew all things,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 20. The HOLY GHOST, that is, was their ſecurity from infection; which is here called the UNCTION or <hi>anointing,</hi> 
                           <hi rend="sup">1.</hi> becauſe by the coming down of this upon our Saviour, He was made the CHRIST or anointed of God, x. <hi>Acts</hi>
                           <pb n="227" facs="tcp:204181:126"/>38. And <hi rend="sup">2.</hi> the Apoſtles when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it were made the principal Officers in his Kingdom, and endued with ſuch a power to remit ſins and unlooſe men from the puniſhment of them as he had, xx. <hi>Joh.</hi> 22, 23. And <hi rend="sup">3.</hi> all others to whom they imparted this gift were openly declared <hi>the children of God,</hi> and if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joynt-heirs with Chriſt, viii. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16, 17. This UNCTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON made them all <hi>Kings and Prieſts unto God, and they reigned with him on Earth,</hi> v. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. Enjoyed, that is, many royal priviledges and liberties at preſent, for which they were bound perpetually to praiſe him; beſide the right it gave them to an Heavenly Kingdom, where they ſhould <hi>ſit down with him in his Throne,</hi> as He was in the Throne of his Father, iii. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. For the Thrones of the Eaſtern Princes were wide and large, as I told you before, where others might ſit down by them, if they pleaſed to admit any to that high honour, which this King of Kings promiſes to grant to his faithful follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                        <p>No wonder then that they who were deſigned to ſo great glory, were alſo made partaker of the <hi>Earneſt</hi> of it, as this <hi>Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                           <pb n="228" facs="tcp:204181:127"/>by the Holy Spirit is called, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 22. After God had filled the Apoſtles and other Apoſtolical men with the Holy Ghoſt, who were ready to guide and direct all Chriſtian people while they lived: There were great numbers alſo in the Body of the Church, who received ſo many of its gifts <hi>from the HOLY one</hi> (that is, God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 21.) that it enabled them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern truth from falſhood; and diſcover all thoſe cheats and impoſtures which ſome went about to put upon them, under the name of Chriſtian Doctrine. A very great Doctor the Holy Ghoſt was, when they were anointed with it; for thereby they KNEW ALL THINGS: that is, their whole Religion, in which it made them ſo perfect, that thoſe pretenders to new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations could teach them nothing which they knew not already. For it taught them that <hi>Jeſus</hi> from whom it came, was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and had revealed all God's will plainly and fully to them. So S. <hi>John</hi> tells them in the following verſes, 21, 22. <hi>I have not written unto you, becauſe ye know not the truth; but becauſe ye know it, and that no lye is of the truth. Who is a lyar, but he that denieth that Jeſus is the Chriſt?</hi> &amp;c. That is, I do not ſpeak of this, becauſe you are ignorant of Chriſtianity, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:204181:127"/>you are well acquainted with it; and thereby able to judge when any body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts it, and to reject all thoſe as lyars, who deny <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be anointed by God, the Lord of all. I know you are well principled in this truth by the UNCTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON which he hath given you from the Father: All that I deſire is (as he adds, <hi>ver.</hi> 24.) that you would ſuffer that Truth <hi>which you have heard from the beginning,</hi> to abide in you. And indeed it was very unreaſonable to ſtart from that which had ever been acknowledged ſince the Holy Ghoſt firſt deſcended on <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf; and which the ſame UNCTION ſtill te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, whenſoever the Apoſtles, who preached <hi>Jeſus,</hi> did but lay their hands on any bodies head, and pray to <hi>Jeſus</hi> that he would beſtow it on them. They could not be ſeduced if they did but attend, as he ſays, <hi>ver.</hi> 26, 27. to this <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which they had received, and which was yet among them.</hi> There was no need of any other teacher, but this to inſtruct them. Which gave ſuch an evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the power and glory of the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and was ſo far from being a lye or deceiving them, that if they did but do it as it <hi>taught</hi> them, they muſt <hi>needs abide in him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="230" facs="tcp:204181:128"/>This you ſee was accounted and that juſtly, an infallible witneſs to him. He could never have ſent ſuch an UNCTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON, nor would the Holy Ghoſt have ever come in his Name, if he had not been the King of Heaven. They that received this had an invincible proof of his glory and majeſty within themſelves. They could not doubt of it any more than they could of what they felt. Which proved like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo convincing to others, that it made unbelievers fall down on their faces and worſhip God; <hi>and report that God was in them of a truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. 25. For by this the Divine Majeſty did in a proper ſence <hi>DWELL among Chriſtian people, and walk with them,</hi> as it did among the ancient <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 16. This was a glorious Divine Preſence in the Church, whereby God and our Saviour <hi>made their ABODE with them,</hi> xiv. <hi>John</hi> 23. and they became <hi>the HABITATION of God</hi> (or his Dwelling place) <hi>through the Spirit,</hi> ii. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 22.</p>
                        <p>Which ſo conſtantly bare witneſs to him, that no man who had this Spirit could poſſibly deny him; but every one that ſpake by the Holy Ghoſt acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:204181:128"/>
                           <hi>Jeſus to be the LORD,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 3. And they were no ſmall number, who were made partakers of it. For S. <hi>Peter</hi> promiſes it at the very firſt deſcent of it, to all that would repent and be baptized in the name of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> at which word <hi>three thouſand Souls were added to them,</hi> ii. <hi>Acts</hi> 38, 41. And afterwards a vaſt company more, as you may read in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Where ſome were endued with one power of the Holy Ghoſt, ſome with another (Chap. xii.) but <hi>in every thing they were enriched by him, ſo that they came behind in NO GIFT,</hi> Chap. i. 5, 7. Wherein our Lord far excelled <hi>Moſes</hi> who could not give his Spirit unto others, much leſs unto the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> whereas <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſent great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Spirit, as you ſee upon his Diſciples, and gave even to the <hi>Gentiles the like gift as he did unto them,</hi> xi. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. For as S. <hi>Peter</hi> was preaching to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his friends, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them which heard the word,</hi> to the great aſtoniſhment of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians, who wondred <hi>to hear them ſpeak with tongues, and magnifie God,</hi> x. <hi>Acts</hi> 44, 45, 46. But they ſhould have conſidered that now he began to fulfil completely that prophecy of <hi>Joel</hi> (mentioned ii. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.) which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:204181:129"/>that God would <hi>pour out of his Spirit upon ALL fleſh.</hi> Now the incloſures were firſt broken down, and that Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence which had hitherto been confined to one Nation, appeared in a moſt amazing luſtre to the reſt of the World. In ſo much that in a little time great multitudes of all nations, and kindred, and people, and tongues joyned their hearts and voices with the Heavenly Quire, ſaying, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hoſts: the whole Earth is full of his GLORY.</hi> Thus <hi>Eſaias</hi> heard the Angels ſing, vi. 3. when <hi>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held our Saviours glory and ſpake of him,</hi> xii. <hi>John</hi> 39. And the Church of Chriſt from the beginning hath taken theſe words from their mouths, and made them their own; (iv. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.) when they actually ſaw this GLORY OF THE LORD filling the Earth, with its moſt holy Preſence. For our Lord did not ceaſe to pour out more and more of his Spirit <hi>on all fleſh,</hi> even after the Apoſtles were dead: But as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> tells the <hi>Jew,</hi> in his time (which was above an hundred years after this) <gap reason="foreign">

For the ſame <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſays in his firſt Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, that there were many healed by the Name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt in the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> whom no other perſon could heal.

                        <p>But intending hereafter to treat of all theſe gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> alone by themſelves; I ſhay ſay no more of them now: having ſufficiently ſhown, how they were his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to our Saviour.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:204181:130"/>It is poſſible, I confeſs, that there may be another thing included in the name of the HOLY GHOST; and that is the old Prophets, who received gifts from Heaven, whereby they ſometimes ſpake of the Meſſiah. So the HOLY GHOST is ſaid in the x. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 15. to be a witneſs of the perfection of our Saviours oblation; and for a proof of it the teſtimony of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is alledged, whoſe words are called the <hi>witneſs of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> From whence I might take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſhow that all the predictions of the Prophets do ſo exactly agree to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and are ſo perfectly fulfilled in him, that we muſt needs grant him (if we receive this teſtimony of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and take them to have been inſpired thereby) to be the Son of God, the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who they had long put that Nation in hope, ſhould come and reign over them. But this would be a work of too great length, and my intention is not to ſwell this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe into an huge Volume; which makes me only mention this notion, that you may conſider with your ſelves, as you have occaſion, what a reſemblance there is between <hi>Jeſus</hi> and that perſon whom the Prophets deſcribe unto us. For this will prove a great confirmation of your faith in
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:204181:130"/>him; there being no doubt in the minds of the bittereſt enemies of our Saviour, but that thoſe <hi>Holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have done now with theſe <hi>witneſſes,</hi> who ſpeak unto us from <hi>Heaven;</hi> and who <hi>are one,</hi> you ſee, in their teſtimony, as well as in their nature. They all agree in this, that <hi>Jeſus is the Son of God.</hi> There is not the leaſt difference between them; no doubtfulneſs in their teſtimony; no backwardneſs to give it; no obſcurity that ſhould make it difficult for us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it: But with one mouth (as we ſay) they unanimouſly, plainly, readily and clearly pronounce him to be ſuch a Divine perſon, that if we ſhould not hear him, and obey him, and depend upon him, I know not what we ſhall be able to ſay to ſo many Witneſſes, who will be ready to appear againſt us; whoſe teſtimony without any cauſe was ſlighted by us. Look how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny voices have been heard from Heaven; how many witneſſes have openly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his behalf: ſo many Divine reaſons you are to conceive your ſelf to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded withall, for every word that <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath ſpoken. Which you are therefore to take for infallible, and to keep, as the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:204181:131"/>Apoſtle ſpeaks (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi: 14.) <hi>without ſpot and unrebukeable,</hi> until his ſecond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing. Liſten to thoſe words of grace which come out of his mouth. Abandon thoſe ſins which he requires you to forſake; and betake your ſelves to the practice of thoſe vertues which he ſo ſtrictly injoyns: For the FATHER, the WORD, and the HOLY GHOST declare that this is the Will of Heaven; And what is there in this world ſo conſiderable as to perſwade the contrary? If he be not the <hi>Son of God,</hi> if he do not prove it by undeniable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then do as you liſt: But if he be, then you are bound to yield him the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt ſubjection, and it will be a ſtrange ſtupidity to diſpute the matter with him. There can be no colour for your refuſal, ſhould you deny to be governed by him, who comes with ſuch Authority; that the <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead,</hi> as you have heard, <hi>dwells in him bodily.</hi>

                        <p>O what an honour hath God Almighty hereby done our nature! how highly hath he advanced and dignified it, by this ſtrange and unexpected favour, which he hath conferred on it, in making it his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place! Conſider but what I have now ſaid, of the Teſtimony of the HOLY
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:204181:131"/>GHOST to <hi>Jeſus;</hi> which was an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious token likewiſe of Gods wonderful love to us. Is it nothing that God ſhould be <hi>manifeſted</hi> in our fleſh; that he ſhould DWELL in us, and make his <hi>abode</hi> with us, and that we ſhould become the <hi>habitation of God</hi> through the Spirit? Look upon the Temple of old, and ſee how it glittered with Gold; how it was adorned with Cherubims and Seraphims, which were an emblem of the Angelical atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in that place; but eſpecially how it ſhined with the <hi>Glory of the Lord,</hi> which appeared upon the mercy-ſeat: And then reflect how precious, how dear mankind are to Almighty God, into whoſe Nature this Glory is tranſlated; whom he hath beautified with greater excellencies, and made more ſplendid by a more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate conjunction with it. Could any man then, after he had conſidered this, profane that Nature which God hath ſo ſanctified and ſeparated to himſelf? Could he find in his heart to proſtitute himſelf to any of thoſe baſe and filthy actions; that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the dignity of humane nature naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, without ſuch a preſence of God in it? None can ſubmit ſure to the government of any fleſhly luſt, but he muſt firſt forget that he is a man, created
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:204181:132"/>after the Image of God. And there is none can continue in this unworthy ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but he muſt lay aſide theſe thoughts alſo; that the WORD was made fleſh, and the Image of the inviſible God hath taken up his abode in our Nature. By this he hath called us to the greateſt ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He remembers us what excellent Creatures we are, and how Glorious he is deſirous to make us. And who is there that need deſpair of recovering himſelf by the grace of God, though he be ſunk never ſo much below himſelf; now that God is come on purpoſe to lift him up? He hath ſent Salvation to us, by one that is mighty to ſave. He hath revealed himſelf ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, and made ſuch diſcoveries of his Love and Power and Glory to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that they may confidently hope, if they will not caſt away all care of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be reſtored to the image and likeneſs of God again.</p>
                        <p>But this Diſcourſe will come in more ſeaſonably, when we have joyned the ſtrength of the other <hi>three Witneſſes</hi> to theſe, and heard them all together, ſome from Heaven, others from Earth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming this in our ears; <hi>Behold the Son of God: Jeſus</hi> is your Lord; for he is the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:204181:132"/>Lord of all things. And we ſhall be the more ready for a ſurrender to him, when we ſee withall, how much we are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to God Almighty for his marvellous, inconceiveable love, in calling us ſo many ways, by ſo many arguments, to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Faith, Obedience and Everlaſting Salvation. That which I have now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, deſerves to be remembred with the moſt affectionate acknowledgments, and we ſhall be better diſpoſed to hearken to the reſt, if we give him hearty thanks for what we underſtand already, and ſay;</p>

For ſhould any be ſo bold as to diſpute that there might be no ſuch
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:204181:136"/>voices from Heaven, ſuch apparitions of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſuch a deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt (as it is poſſible there may be ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited fools, who think themſelves wiſe by doubting of all things) yet that there were ſuch Witneſſes as the WATER, the BLOUD, and the SPIRIT, no man can be ſo obſtinate as to deny; they were ſo viſible to all ſorts of men whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that would but open their eyes to behold them.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>ſixth</hi> verſe (of which the <hi>eighth</hi> is but a repetition) after the Apoſtle had ſaid, that the only Conqueror is he who believes <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the Son of God; He adds, <hi>This is he that came by WATER and BLOUD, even Jeſus Chriſt; not by Water only, but by Bloud alſo: and it is the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT that beareth witneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Where that phraſe [HE CAME] is to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerved; which in the ſtile of the New Teſtament writers, ſignifies as much as that, He manifeſted himſelf to be the Meſſias or Chriſt; He made it appear that he was ſent of God.

And ſo He is ſaid to be <hi>the light which COMING into the World enlightneth every man,</hi> i. <hi>John</hi> 9. And <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt tells them, <hi>He that COMETH after me, is preferred before me, ver.</hi> 15. He was preferred to be their <hi>King,</hi> as the multitude cried out, ſaying, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David, bleſſed be he that COMETH in the Name of the Lord,</hi> xxi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. There is the true explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the phraſe: He was <hi>ſent</hi> by a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al commiſſion, ſuch as never any man had from God the Father; he appeared with his authority, and acted in his <hi>name.</hi> And as before he appeared in his Majeſty, he was called, <hi>He that COMETH;</hi> ſo afterwards the Apoſtle here calls him, <hi>He that CAME.</hi> The perſon, that is, whom God had promiſed from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world to <hi>ſend</hi> into it; His SHILO, that is, <hi>his Seed</hi> (as <hi>De Dieu</hi> hath excellently expounded that word) the Seed of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Son of God. Who in this fulneſs of time was to receive Commiſſion from God, and take upon him the Government of the World.</p>
                     <p>Now this perſon, ſays S. <hi>John,</hi> CAME
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:204181:137"/>(that is, appeared to be ſent of God as his <hi>Son,</hi> his <hi>only begotten) by Water and by Bloud.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, that it was manifeſt he <hi>came</hi> from God and not of himſelf by theſe two Witneſſes; to which the SPIRIT alſo adds its teſtimony, as it here follows <hi>[and the SPIRIT bears witneſs]</hi> which is ſuch a certain evidence, that they who rely on this, together with the former, can never be deceived by it; <hi>becauſe the Spirit is the TRUTH.</hi> As therefore God SENT him, ſo he CAME; and by theſe <hi>three Witneſſes</hi> proved that he was the Perſon, who, God promiſed, ſhould <hi>come,</hi> and was now <hi>ſent:</hi> whoſe teſtimony let us prepare our ſelves to hear, and examine diligently, that the faith of Chriſt may ſtill be rooted deeper in our hearts. And let us hear them, if you pleaſe, in that order wherein they ſtand in the <hi>ſixth</hi> Verſe (the place where we firſt meet with them) receiving firſt the teſtimony of the WATER, then of the BLOUD, and then of the SPIRIT.</p>

                        <p>Firſt then let us take it in the notion of PURITY; which we uſe the help of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to procure in bodily defilements. And therefore when the Prophet would expreſs the intention of God to purifie his people from moral filthineſs, he ſays he will <hi>pour clean WATER upon them,</hi> xxxvi. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25. and in other places he calls upon them to <hi>WASH themſelves;</hi> when he would have them amend their ways, and lead new and holy lives. And when we ſpeak of the PURITY of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> wherewith he CAME, that is, demonſtrated himſelf to be the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> we muſt conſider that there is a double <hi>Sanctity</hi> or holineſs, for which He was eminent above all other perſons, which may both be denoted by WATER. The one is of his DOCTRINE where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt is ſaid to cleanſe his Church, for which he died, v. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 26. <hi>He gave
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:204181:138"/>himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie it; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cleanſed it with the Waſhing of WATER by the Word.</hi> Where <hi>the Word</hi> (the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel) is either the explanation of <hi>waſhing with Water,</hi> or elſe denotes that Chriſtian Inſtruction which ſucceeds Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; to which, by our being <hi>waſhed with Water</hi> in the Name of Chriſt, we are bound to attend, as the great inſtrument of our purification. The other is holineſs of LIFE <hi>and converſation;</hi> which the ſame word WATER is uſed to expreſs in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> x. 22. where the Apoſtle exhorts all thoſe who believed there was ſuch a royal High Prieſt as <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſet over the family of God, to worſhip him with integrity of heart and ſincere affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him; nothing doubting of the truth of his promiſes, and <hi>having their hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and their bodies waſhed with pure WATER.</hi> Now by a ſhort view of the perfect ſpotleſneſs of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in both theſe, in regard of his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> and in regard of his <hi>Life;</hi> we ſhall be able from thence ſtrongly to draw this concluſion, that he muſt needs be the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">I. Firſt for the PURITY of his DOCTRINE; it is ſuch, that it not
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:204181:138"/>only teaches no evil at all, but teaches all manner of Goodneſs; and ſeverely prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits every vice. There is not the leaſt ſin to which the Holy <hi>Jeſus</hi> gives any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; no, he declares <hi>the wrath of God from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs of men;</hi> whom he fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs likewiſe and encourages in every piece of true piety and vertue. So perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Holy is his <hi>Word,</hi> that if we did enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, the power of it would throughly waſh us from all uncleanneſs, and not leave the leaſt ſpeck of dirt in our hearts. For he intends by <hi>that</hi> (as the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Epheſians</hi> in the words following thoſe now named, <hi>ver.</hi> 27.) <hi>to preſent to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi> Whatſoever belongs either to our <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, or to our <hi>Duty</hi> in every reſpect, condition and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, His Doctrine completely compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends it.</p>
                        <p>He hath <hi>firſt</hi> of all ſo clearly revealed to us the ONE GOD Creator of Heaven and Earth, that none could do it more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, or with greater reverence to his Majeſty. Whatſoever <hi>Moſes</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt Idolatry, S. <hi>John</hi> here from
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:204181:139"/>
                           <hi>Jeſus</hi> (in the concluſion of his Epiſtle) hath ſummed it up in a few words, <hi>Little children, keep your ſelves from IDOLS.</hi> In this the <hi>Jews</hi> could not accuſe him, nor durſt let ſuch a word fall from their mouths, that he was a falſe Prophet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he endeavoured to draw their hearts after other Gods (which was the great mark of an Impoſtor, xiii. <hi>Deut.</hi>) No, he tells them that <hi>this is Eternal Life, to know the only true God</hi> (which words are ſpoken in oppoſition to all others) <hi>and Jeſus Chriſt whom he had ſent.</hi> But in this they might have ſeen that his deſign was far more noble and glorious than that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who contented himſelf to preſerve that one Nation from the infection of Idolatry: whereas our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> plainly declared his intention was by his Apoſtles <hi>to turn</hi> all Nations <hi>from Idols, to ſerve the living and true God.</hi> There was never any man that appeared ſo great a lover of God as he was. Never any man that undertook to ſet on foot ſuch a deſign, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the univerſal knowledge of him. All the Divine Attributes and Perfections alſo, He hath revealed ſo perſpicuouſly, that there never was ſuch a manifeſtation made of them to the World, as we ſee in Him. From whom we learn how Juſt,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:204181:139"/>how Good, how Wiſe, how Faithful, and how Powerful, <hi>the Bleſſed and only Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate is, who only hath immortality, whom no man hath ſeen or can ſee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And if we would know our <hi>Duty,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards God in actions of <hi>Piety,</hi> or towards Men in actions of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> or towards our ſelves in actions of <hi>ſobriety,</hi> we can learn it no where ſo eaſily, and completely, as if we go to him, and to thoſe who have delivered it to us with great care and plainneſs from his mouth.</p>
                        <p>As for the Actions of PIETY, He teaches us <hi>inwardly</hi> to <hi>Honour God,</hi> v. <hi>Joh.</hi> 23. that is, to have an high eſteem of him as our Lord, and as our chiefeſt Good: to <hi>Love</hi> him alſo, and that with all our heart, and all our Soul, and all our mind, and all our ſtrength, xii. <hi>Mark</hi> 30. And to <hi>Fear</hi> him, ſeeing he can caſt both Body and Soul into Hell; which makes him again and again bid us be ſure to <hi>Fear him,</hi> xii. <hi>Luke</hi> 4, 5. To confide likewiſe and <hi>Truſt</hi> in him, the living God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 10. To <hi>Hope</hi> in his mercy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 21. And to <hi>rejoyce</hi> evermore, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 16.</p>
                        <p>And as we are thus to worſhip him in
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:204181:140"/>our Minds, ſo we are taught by his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>externally</hi> to <hi>adore</hi> him and <hi>fall down</hi> before him, iv. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. iv. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. to <hi>pray</hi> to him both for our ſelves and others, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 1, 8. and to be <hi>inceſſant</hi> in our Prayers (or to perform this holy duty very oft) xviii. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 17. and <hi>to offer up by him the ſacrifice of Praiſe to God continually,</hi> xiii. <hi>Heb.</hi> 15. <hi>And in every thing to give thanks, which is the will of God concerning us in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 18. and eſpecially <hi>to ſhew the Lords death,</hi> that is, publiſh it with thanks and praiſe, <hi>till he come,</hi> to judge the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 26.</p>
                        <p>The manner alſo of addreſſing our ſelves to God he hath taught us ſo fully, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be added to it. For he tells us, <hi>The Father will be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> iv. <hi>John</hi> 23. And that we muſt <hi>lift up holy hands,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 8.

                           <pb n="255" facs="tcp:204181:140"/>To which he adds as rare Precepts for Actions of RIGHTEOUSNESS: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which he hath given us ſuch an abſolutely perfect Rule, that it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the meaſures of CHARITY too. No wit of man can think of any thing more holy than that, LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THY SELF; or that, WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM. This is a rule that reaches all men; and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, yet completely, tells them how they ſhould behave themſelves towards each other. If a man were a Magiſtrate, or a Parent, or ſtood in any other ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority over his Neighbours, he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire honour and obedience from them; that therefore, ſays our Saviour, let him give to thoſe who are in Authority. If a man be our equal, we deſire, if not his friendſhip, yet his fidelity in word and deed; that very thing let us be ſure to render him and all others in the ſame equality with us. If we be placed below others, we deſire the favour, the help, the relief, and counſel of our Betters; all theſe <hi>Jeſus</hi> here teaches us to afford, with the ſame chearfulneſs that we would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them in their caſe, to thoſe who are
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:204181:141"/>in want of our kind aſſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>Nay, he hath told us in <hi>particular</hi> what our duty is in theſe matters, by the mouths of his holy Apoſtles; that no man may think to excuſe himſelf by his ignorance and inability to apply a <hi>general</hi> Rule to every action of his life. I ſhall not name all the places where you may find ſuch words as theſe that follow, but only tell you, He would have us ſo far from doing evil to any man, that he requires us <hi>owe him nothing, but only love.</hi> And this debt we muſt be <hi>always</hi> paying, and think our ſelves debtors to <hi>all men;</hi> not only to treat them civilly, and give them good words, but <hi>to love them in deed and in truth.</hi> Which Love muſt teach us as to be <hi>meek and gentle</hi> towards all men; <hi>to put away all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil ſpeaking;</hi> not to circumvent or <hi>go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our Brother in any matter;</hi> not <hi>to lye to our neighbour;</hi> nor <hi>defame</hi> him; much leſs <hi>do him any hurt</hi> in his body or goods: So to relieve his poverty; to help forward his joy; to comfort him in his ſorrow; to cover his defects; to make a fair interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his actions; to let <hi>our judgment</hi> of him incline to the more favourable ſide; to mind what is <hi>lovely</hi> or grateful to others,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:204181:141"/>and what things are of <hi>good report;</hi> to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy things that <hi>make for peace;</hi> to compoſe and <hi>reconcile</hi> differences; to <hi>beg pardon</hi> of thoſe whom we have offended, and make them ſatisfaction; and if any have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, readily <hi>to forgive</hi> their fault; to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear revenge</hi> when it is in our power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite an injury; to <hi>do good for evil;</hi> to <hi>bleſs thoſe that curſe us;</hi> to overcome mens <hi>hatred</hi> with <hi>benefits;</hi> to <hi>pray to God for thoſe who uſe us deſpitefully;</hi> and to be <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering,</hi> when it is fit to puniſh any man for his crime. And as for thoſe who are truly pious, we are taught <hi>to do them good above all other men;</hi> to live with them <hi>in unity</hi> and godly love; to <hi>ſympathize</hi> with them in their ſeveral conditions; <hi>rejoycing with thoſe that do rejoyce, and weeping with thoſe that weep.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor hath he failed to tell us by his holy Apoſtles, with what kindneſs and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent affection <hi>Husbands</hi> ſhould treat their <hi>Wives;</hi> and how they again ſhould ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately obſerve their Husbands, that they may together make up a lively Image of that Deareſt Love, which is between Chriſt and his Church. And he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed us all how to behave our ſelves towards <hi>Magiſtrates, Biſhops, Presbyters,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:204181:142"/>Maſters</hi> and <hi>Parents;</hi> whom he hath alſo taught how to bring up their <hi>children,</hi> to uſe their <hi>ſervants,</hi> to feed and govern their <hi>flocks,</hi> and to rule their <hi>people</hi> committed to their charge: ſo that no man can ſay he goes without that Leſſon, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for his condition.</p>
                        <p>And then if we proceed to thoſe things which we call SOBRIETY, his Doctrine is ſo holy and pure, that it requires the greateſt Moderation in all things. It fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours nothing that reliſhes of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Ambition, or Voluptuouſneſs, or any other violent and inordinate paſſion whatſoever. But quite contrary, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us <hi>not to labour,</hi> with too much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs and ſolicitude, <hi>for the meat that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes;</hi> to <hi>lay up our treaſures in Heaven;</hi> to be <hi>humble and lowly,</hi> like little children; to be <hi>temperate in all things;</hi> to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and vigilant, leſt we be <hi>overtaken with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſs or the cares of this life;</hi> to be <hi>chaſte and pure in heart;</hi> to <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our members that are on the Earth, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, uncleanneſs, inordinate affection, and evil concupiſcence;</hi> to abſtain from <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciviouſneſs, fooliſh talking, wanton and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly jeſting;</hi> to <hi>cut off our right hand</hi> and <hi>pluck out our right eye,</hi> if it prove an offence
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:204181:142"/>to us; to take juſt meaſures of our ſelves, as well as others; to be <hi>content</hi> with our portion; to do thoſe things which are <hi>venerable,</hi> grave and beſeeming our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and employment: which if it be not according to our deſires, not to repine or be dejected at it; if it be, not to be tranſported with vain joy, much leſs with pride and contempt of our neighbours.</p>
                        <p>And after all theſe and ſuch like incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Leſſons, He teaches us to <hi>ſuffer</hi> any thing for well doing; to bear all worldly troubles valiantly and with a magnanimous heart; to deſpiſe reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; nay, to rejoyce when our names are caſt out as evil, <hi>for his name ſake;</hi> in <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to poſſeſs our Souls;</hi> and <hi>not to be weary</hi> in <hi>well doing,</hi> nor <hi>faint in our minds;</hi> but <hi>to endure chaſtening;</hi> to perſevere and <hi>ſuffer with long patience;</hi> to <hi>stand faſt in the faith;</hi> to <hi>quit our ſelves like men,</hi> and <hi>to be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To all which duties he urges us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by the pureſt, the moſt ſpiritual, the nobleſt and moſt Divine Arguments. He does not preſs us with ſuch low and poor motives as the hope of Riches (though he promiſe us things convenient)
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:204181:143"/>or of Greatneſs, or of Fame and Glory; either while we live or when we are dead: but propounds his own example to us, and the example of all the Saints that are gone before us; and quickens us with the hope of Immortality when we depart this life; and aſſures us at preſent of the friendly protection of Angels, and of the joys of the Holy Ghoſt: which none of thoſe ſhall fail to receive, who are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed nor affrighted from their duty; but reſolutely hold out in their Chriſtian war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and overcome.</p>
                        <p>And if any man ſay, that ſeveral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers taught excellent things, and gave Rules of a vertuous life; and yet it does not prove the beſt of them to be ſo great, as theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are brought to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate our Saviour was: The Anſwer is, that none of them delivered ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Rule of holy living as our Lord hath done; none of them touched the heart with ſuch powerful reaſons and Divine motives; nor did any of them write with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome mixture of folly; or themſelves exactly perform that which they taught others. Beſides, that none of them ever had the confidence to pretend to that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, wherein our Saviour <hi>came;</hi> which
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:204181:143"/>you ſhall ſee preſently is of great force to prove ſuch an Holy Perſon as he was, to be indeed what he pretended; <hi>the Son of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. But firſt let us a little conſider the <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort of PURITY, that of the <hi>Life;</hi> in which our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> far out-ſtript all others. He did not only preach after that manner I have now related; but ſo he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and became a complete pattern of that which he taught. He was a LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VING LAW, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> calls him
<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Inſtit. C.</hi> 25</note>, to all his Diſciples; whom he taught by Himſelf, and not merely by his Lectures of Piety. Other Teachers had conceived in their minds and painted in their Orations a vertue that was no where to be ſeen; for they were not able (as the ſame Author elſe-where ſpeaks) to confirm by preſent Examples, that which they aſſerted in their Doctrine. Their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors might ſtill ſay, that no body could live according to their preſcriptions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no body ever did. Behold, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour comes <hi>to do,</hi> and not only to preach, <hi>the will of God.</hi> And ſo holy, pure and free from all blame were all the <hi>Actions</hi> of his life; that his greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could lay nothing to his charge, but
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:204181:144"/>only certain <hi>words:</hi> and thoſe, ſuch as contained moſt perfect truth, as he proved by his actions and many other ways.</p>
                        <p>He was the Lamb of God <hi>without ſpot, and without blemiſh,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 19. He offered himſelf by the eternal Spirit <hi>without ſpot</hi> unto God, ix. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 14. His whole life was ſuch a fair example of that Piety, Humility, Charity, Gentleneſs, Forgiveneſs, Peaceableneſs, Patience, and all other vertues which he taught; that God reſtored him to life again, after they had crucified him and put him to death, becauſe there was no fault in him. He was frequent in Prayer to God; and ſometimes continued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a whole night together. Upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions he gave him thanks. He loved his Glory and the Good of mankind, more than his life. He went about doing good. And he taught his Family to be as kind and tender-hearted as himſelf. He was meek and lowly in heart. When he was abuſed, He was dumb as a Lamb before the ſhearers, ſo opened he not his mouth. He was full of reſpect towards Magiſtrates and Governours; very ſweet and affable towards the pooreſt people; exceeding kind and compaſſionate towards his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:204181:144"/>enemies; and perfectly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the loweſt condition. When Foxes had holes, and Birds had neſts, but He not where to lay his head; none could be found more chearful, thankful, and well pleaſed than he was. And as for his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Courage, Conſtancy, Reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all other ſuffering vertues; there never was any thing comparable to them. For he endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame, and contentedly took the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of ſinners, ſaying, <hi>Father, not my will, but thy will be done.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To all which you muſt add, that he was thus pure and undefiled, thus perfectly pious, juſt and good, in an Age that was levened with the doctrine of the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> who by their Traditions had made void the Law of God. Then he was complete in all manner of God-like qualities; when the ſtricteſt Sect of Religious people were utterly void even of common honeſty. In thoſe days he did all things that <hi>God</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; when it was counted the greateſt ſanctity to do little but what <hi>men</hi> preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. When vertue was deſpiſed, when Faith and Judgment and the Love of God were hated, when there was nothing but the very dregs of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Piety remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:204181:145"/>among his Children; then <hi>Jeſus</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to them that their deeds were evil; then this light ſhined in that darkneſs; and this Son of God entred upon a more than <hi>Herculean</hi> labour, of cleanſing the Temple and the People, that were fuller of filth than the <hi>Augaean</hi> Stable.</p>
                        <p>And it is moreover to be conſidered, that though he oppoſed thoſe idle traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theirs, which evacuated the Laws of God; yet he neglected none of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial ordinances of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fulfilled all righteouſneſs. No body could accuſe him for the breach of any Commandment, that had a Divine ſtamp upon it. When they quarrelled with him for healing on the Sabbath day; He ſoon ſtopt their mouths by ſhowing them that they themſelves would not deny ſuch a charity to an Oxe or an Aſſe upon that day; if it were in danger of periſhing, or ſtood in need to be led away to watering. Nor was this ſo great a labour in him, as it was for them to pull a beaſt out of a pit; for he did but ſpeak a word, and the cure was done, without any further pains. They did but diſcover therefore, in theſe exceptions, their own rancorous malice and baſe hypocriſie; who ſcrupled ſuch
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:204181:145"/>charitable actions as theſe on the Sabbath day, but made no bones, as we ſay, at any time to undo even a poor widow; whoſe houſe their Conſcience was wide enough to ſwallow. By his ſharp but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reproof of ſuch crimes, he incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their hatred. Which could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten him in his duty; but ſtill he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his free admonitions and reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, though he knew it might coſt him the loſs of his life. The doing of Gods will was a great deal dearer to him than that. For this end he came into the world, as he told <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he might bear witneſs to the Truth. And therefore it was his meat, his great delight, to do the will of him that ſent him, and to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his work.</p>
                        <p>To conclude this; ſo free from all ſpot was the Holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that the Devils ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice could not tell what fault to charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. But, as <hi>Euſebius</hi>

All that he was able to ſay in detraction from his honour, was this, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did fooliſhly to worſhip him: Though he granted him to be carried to Heaven, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </p>
                        <p>It was very cautiouſly ſpoken, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no doubt the pity of Chriſtian people towards one that thought himſelf ſo know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For whatſoever he unskilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, we are able to make it appear, that we do well to worſhip and honour him, even as we honour the Father of all: ſince his life is confeſſed by his Enemies to be perfectly pure and unſpotted; and his Doctrine teaches men nothing, but to do as he did. This concluſion we ſhall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily draw from the premiſes, if they be but diligently conſidered. And</p>

                           <pb n="267" facs="tcp:204181:146"/>1. Firſt of all, it ſeems to me incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that any one but he that was in the very boſom of God (that is, knew his mind moſt intimately, as I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;) ſhould be able to declare his will ſo fully, and to give ſuch a Divine Rule of holineſs as <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath done, even by the mouth of thoſe who were skilled in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but how to mend a Net, or catch Fiſh, or ſome ſuch poor artifice, till he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired them. All the words that he ſpake himſelf, both for the matter and manner of them, do not ſound like the words of a Man, but of a God. <hi>Never man ſpake like this man,</hi> ſay they, that did not go to be inſtructed by him, but to apprehend him, vii. <hi>John</hi> 46. The report of others did not make him ſo great, as they found him, when they came to ſee and hear him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Bad men are commonly more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to us when we enter into converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them, than they were whileſt we remained ſtrangers, and had nothing to do with them. Nay, perſons of known worth are ſometimes more magnified by ſame, than they appear when we approach nearer them. But <hi>Jeſus</hi> was every where admired and glorified; and never more, than when men grew the moſt familiar
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:204181:147"/>with him. None could deſpiſe, though they might hate him, unleſs it was when he thought good to ſay nothing, and to work no miracles; which made <hi>Herod</hi> and his men of war ſet him at naught. When he opened his mouth, they that did not believe on him, wondred, as you have heard, at the gracious words which thence proceeded.</p>
                        <p>For beſide that his Diſcourſes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably beyond the common pitch of wiſe men, his delivery of them was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Divine; for he ſpake <hi>with authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and was <hi>a Prophet,</hi> as the Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus</hi> relate to himſelf, <hi>Mighty in deed and word before God, and all the people,</hi> xxiv. 19. And ſuch were thoſe poor ignorant men, whom he choſe to be his Apoſtles. Who not only convinced gain-ſayers with the ſtrength of Divine Arguments, but alſo delivered Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for good Manners, with ſuch exactneſs and ſuch plainneſs of ſpeech; ſo familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo agreeably to the nobleſt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of humane nature: that it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt they underſtood it better than the greateſt Philoſopher of them all. None of them ever deſcribed the ſeveral duties of mankind, and urged them with ſuch
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:204181:147"/>proper arguments, in ſo few words, and yet ſo clearly and fully as theſe illiterate men did. Nor was there ever a ſet of men ſo <hi>affectionately deſirous</hi> of the good of others as theſe men were: who were <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to impart unto them not only the Goſpel of God, but their own Souls alſo; becauſe they were dear unto them.</hi> So S. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> (1 ii. 8.) every one of whom he <hi>exhorted, and comforted, and charged, as a Father doth his children, ver.</hi> 11. But he never uſed any <hi>flattering words</hi> towards them; nor <hi>ſpake as pleaſing men, but God, who trieth the hearts;</hi> nor carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on any deſign of <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> or win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>glory</hi> to himſelf; nor would be, in the leaſt, <hi>burdenſom</hi> to them; but <hi>was gentle among them, even as a nurſe cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her own children, ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
                        <p>Show me the man that ever ſpoke with ſuch wiſdom and judgment, as they did; and with ſo much tenderneſs of heart. None but their Maſter ever preached or wrote with ſo Divine a Spirit: which <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt deſcribes in ſuch words (with which I ſhall content my ſelf) as prove the excellence of his Perſon, from the excellence of his Doctrine, which he delivered unto men. They are in the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:204181:148"/>iii. <hi>John</hi> 31. where he ſays, <hi>He that COMETH from above, is above all: He that is of the Earth, is Earthly, and ſpeaketh of the Earth: He that COMETH from Heaven, is above all.</hi> That is, He who appears from Heaven with ſuch a Divine Authority, who delivers the mind of God in ſo rare a manner, that one may ſee he hath been with God, muſt needs excel all other perſons in dignity; <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and me alſo, who am of an Earthly extraction, born like other men; and can ſpeak only like a man, poor and low things in compariſon with thoſe, which that Heavenly teacher delivers: who, I muſt needs again confeſs, is far ſuperiour to me, becauſe he is not a mere man, but comes from Heaven; and ſo is above all Prophets whatſoever, who had more of the Earth than of Heaven in them; that is, knew none of thoſe ſecret counſels of God concerning mans everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bliſs, nor could direct us in ſo ſhort, but plain and ſure a way to it as he hath done. And then it follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 32, 33. <hi>And what he hath ſeen and heard, that he teſtifieth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeal that God is true. For he whom God hath ſent, ſpeaketh the words of God.</hi> That is, he ſpeaks ſuch things, that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:204181:148"/>a man may eaſily ſee he is the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father, who is in his boſom, and knows his very mind; having as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an underſtanding of Heavenly things, as we have of what we <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>hear.</hi> And therefore whoſoever believes him, does no more but aſſent to God; whoſe words he ſpeaks, by a particular commiſſion he received from him to act in his Name.</p>
                        <p>It is very obſervable that juſt after the mention of theſe Witneſſes, 1 <hi>John</hi> v. 10. S. <hi>John</hi> adds, that <hi>He who believes not this record which God gives of his Son, hath made him a liar:</hi> as on the other ſide <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt here ſays, That <hi>he who doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his teſtimony</hi> (i. e. believes) <hi>ſolemnly acknowledges God to be true.</hi> From whence I conclude, that what is ſaid in this Epiſtle hath a relation to that which is writ in the Goſpel: which I take to be no more than this. That the Divineneſs of <hi>Jeſus</hi> his Doctrine; the purity and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſtrain of his diſcourſes; his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as if he had <hi>heard and ſeen</hi> the Father, and knew the ſtate of things above; his ſpeaking the Words of God (not as <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> like the Prophets before him, but as his <hi>own</hi>) was a great teſtimony to him that he was ſent of God, in that quality
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:204181:149"/>that he pretended: So that they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him did but rely upon the Truth of God, and give up their faith to him; who hereby, as well as other ways, perſwaded them that this was his Son.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But then that which I mainly inſiſt upon is this <hi>ſecond</hi> conſideration. That his pure, moſt holy <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> was a great argument of his Divinity; becauſe this was part of his Doctrine, that he was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> For who can think that a perſon of his vertue, who taught men both by word and deed ſuch reverence to God and ſuch juſtice and charity to men, could be guilty of putting ſuch an open affront upon the one, and ſuch an abuſe upon the other, as to challenge this title and propound himſelf to be received in this quality, if he had not a juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right to it? He that came with ſo much ſanctity and holineſs, in all his other words, and all his other actions, one cannot but conclude was as holy and free from ſin in this as much as in any thing elſe; that he ſaid he was the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and perſwaded the people to believe he was the <hi>Son of the bleſſed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is certain, He affirmed himſelf to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:204181:149"/>be the Chriſt, the Son of God, <hi>firſt</hi> to his Diſciples: And that both before his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, xvi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16, 17. ix. <hi>Mark</hi> 41. and alſo after his reſurrection, xxiv. <hi>Luke</hi> 46. And then to others alſo, who were as yet none of them, as (1.) to the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> iv. <hi>John</hi> 26. Then (2.) to the blind man whoſe eyes he opened, ix. <hi>John</hi> 35, 36, 37. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> he aſſerted it when he was brought before his Judges (as you have heard already) and this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matter was brought in queſtion; yea, when they adjured him by the true God, and as he bare any reſpect to him, to tell them the very truth in this thing. Now who is there that would not infer from hence, that all the reſt of his Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo oppoſite to all lying and every other vice, and his whole life giving ſuch a proof of his perfect vertue, that they had nothing to ground a charge upon againſt him, but merely this profeſſion of his own, wherein, if he had pleaſed, he might have been ſilent; it is not in the leaſt credible that a perſon of his integrity ſhould after ſo long ſpeaking truth, now at the laſt be guilty of ſpeaking a lye? And (2.) a lye of ſuch a dangerous conſequence as this, by which, if it were one, he and a world of Souls muſt be undone? Yea,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:204181:150"/>(3.) that he ſhould tell it ſo often to ſo many perſons? And that (4.) before the Magiſtrates, who are Gods in this world? And that (5.) when they were deſirous and very importunate to know the truth? Yea, (6.) before God himſelf, by whoſe name he was ſolemnly adjured to ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the truth? How is it poſſible that ſuch a man as he ſhould be ſo void of all fear of God, as to offend him in ſo high a manner? There are none ſure whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are ſound, or whoſe conſciences are not crackt, who can ſo much as fancy, much leſs perſwade themſelves to believe, that a perſon whoſe innocence was ſo great, that all the falſe witneſſes they could find, men who cared not for their own lives, could not be maſters of his; ſhould now, in ſuch a ſerious manner, when he was going out of the world, put ſuch an horrid cheat upon it, and with the loſs of his life too upon a ſhameful gibbet, as to ſay that he came from God, if he had no warrant for it. All ſober men muſt rather confidently believe that He who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, as I have often ſaid, at ſuch an height of blameleſs purity in all other points whatſoever, was as free from blame in this alſo; and ſaid nothing but the very Truth, when He ſo ſolemnly and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:204181:150"/>ſo frequently, before God and before men, in his life-time and at his death, profeſſed that he was <hi>the Son of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And if any man ſtill object, that his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs indeed was ſo great that without all doubt he would not invent ſuch a tale as this, and affirm what he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; but yet he might be miſtaken and believe that which was not true: He may anſwer himſelf from his own conceſſions. For if he conſider how free our Saviour was from all ambitious deſires, how mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly he refuſed to be advanced, how void he was of covetouſneſs and all other worldly appetites, which may blind a mans reaſon and abuſe his underſtanding; and likewiſe how admirably he diſcourſes, how rational and convincing, how ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and heavenly all his Sermons are; He will ſoon be ſatisfied, that it is not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible a perſon of his wiſdom ſhould be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by mere fancy; or of his goodneſs, be carried into a vain dream by any ſenſual affections, which had no place in him.</p>
                        <p>This is the firſt acception of the word WATER, which you ſee clears our Lord from all imputation of fraud, and waſhes off all aſperſions that might be caſt upon
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:204181:151"/>him of impoſture. For there is not the leaſt ſpot or blemiſh appears in the whole courſe of his <hi>Life,</hi> to render him ſuſpected of any guile, much leſs of ſo great a deceit as this, to feign himſelf the Son of God. Nay, his <hi>Doctrine</hi> is ſo Divine, ſo much beyond the ſtrain of the wiſeſt men that ever ſpake, that it demonſtrates he was as little obnoxious to be deluded himſelf, as he was inclined and diſpoſed to delude others.</p>

                        <p>Let us now proceed to ſee what teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony may be drawn from this WATER in behalf of our Lord; if we take it in the other ſence, for BAPTISM, in which we make a profeſſion of PURITY. And there is a twofold BAPTISM by which our Lord may be ſaid to COME; that is, to appear a Perſon ſent of God, as his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son: The firſt is <hi>the Baptiſm of John;</hi> the ſecond is his <hi>own</hi> Baptiſm.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. As for the <hi>Baptiſm of John,</hi> it may be ſaid that our Saviour CAME <hi>by</hi> or <hi>with</hi> this WATER; both becauſe <hi>John</hi> when he baptized men with Water, preached that He was <hi>coming,</hi> iii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:204181:151"/>i. <hi>John</hi> 30. and becauſe He brought this Baptiſm along with him, or rather ſent it a little before him, as a teſtimony of him, which would <hi>prepare his way,</hi> and diſpoſe their hearts to receive him as the <hi>Chriſt of God.</hi> For it is manifeſt that it was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a proof of this, from thoſe words of our Saviour himſelf, by which he ſtopt the mouths of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and took away all matter of cavil from them, when he aſſerted his ſupreme Authority both over them and over their Temple, xxi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26. There you read that our Saviour having come in Triumph to <hi>Jeruſalem (ver.</hi> 8, 9.) and there recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s from old and young, and been ſaluted as <hi>the Son of David,</hi> that is, their KING (who the Prophet had ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. ſhould <hi>come</hi> unto them, <hi>meek and ſitting upon the Foal of an Aſſe,</hi>) and he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caſt the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple (<hi>ver.</hi> 12.) and prohibited them to carry ſo much as a veſſel through it (as S. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, xi. 16.) and being now teaching the people there, the Chief Prieſts and the Elders came to him, and examined him <hi>by what Authority</hi> he did theſe things, and <hi>who gave</hi> him this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. That is, they bid him produce his Commiſſion, if he had any, and ſhow
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:204181:152"/>them from whom he was SENT and CAME to take this Office, not only of a Teacher, but of a Reformer, and that of the Temple it ſelf: and likewiſe who warranted him to ride in ſuch pomp to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the <hi>Son of David,</hi> the Lord of that Country.</p>
                        <p>The Anſwer of our Saviour to this queſtion is, that they might ſoon be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if they would but ſatisfie him in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion, concerning another perſon, who was <hi>come</hi> alſo in an unuſual manner among them: And that was, whether <hi>John</hi> had a Commiſſion from God to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, or came of himſelf, by the allowance of men only. Anſwer me but this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſays he, and I will tell you by what authority I do theſe things. Conſider of it, and tell me what you think; <hi>whence was John's Baptiſm? from Heaven, or of Men?</hi> That is, who gave him his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to preach, to reprove, to call men to repentance, to receive confeſſion of ſins, and to do all other things belonging to his Miniſtry, which Baptiſm accompanied, and conſtantly waited upon? Did God bid him go? or was it from a motion of his own?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="279" facs="tcp:204181:152"/>While they conſulted for an Anſwer to this queſtion of our Saviours, they clearly ſaw their <hi>own</hi> anſwered. And they were not ſo dull, but that they could eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our Lord would irrefragably prove his Divine Authority, and make them confeſs he was the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> unleſs they would adventure to ſay that, which all the Country would decry not only as a falſity, but an egregious calumny. For if they had affirmed that <hi>John</hi> entred upon the Office of Baptizing and Teaching the people out of his own private will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, or by commiſſion from ſome men; in this opinion they knew they ſhould be ſingular, becauſe <hi>all the people held him to be a Prophet.</hi> That is, it was the ſence of the whole Nation then (and ſo it was afterward, as appears by <hi>Joſephus</hi>) that the Baptiſt was a Divine Man, inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God, and ſent of him to do what he did: which would have made them the publick ſcorn and hatred, if without a reaſon able to confute all the Country, they ſhould have denied it. But then if they ſhould grant this and ſay, He was ſent of God (which was the only thing they could ſay with ſafety, if they would affirm either) they ſaw themſelves in as
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:204181:153"/>ill or worſe a caſe another way: being as much afraid of what <hi>Jeſus</hi> would ſay, if this were confeſſed, as they were of what the people would ſay, if it were contradicted. For as the people would have cried ſhame on them, if they had diſparaged <hi>John</hi>'s miniſtry, ſo if they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it to be from Heaven, then they knew <hi>Jeſus</hi> would unanſwerably prove his Commiſſion to be from Heaven too: and tell them that <hi>John,</hi> whom they took for a Divine Man, ſhould acquaint them with his authority, and from whom he had it; for he bare witneſs, in expreſs words, that he was the Chriſt, the Son of God. They thought it a ſafer courſe therefore to leave this queſtion undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and to ſay <hi>they could not tell</hi> whence his Baptiſm was, than by reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it either way, to give with their own mouths ſo great an advantage to him, whom they queſtioned and oppoſed.</p>
                        <p>But by ſaying nothing, they plainly confeſſed, that if they had gone on to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with him, He would have had the better of them: and have made it appear from <hi>John</hi> Baptiſts teſtimony, that He had an authority far greater than that which they muſt have acknowledged in
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:204181:153"/>him. For though our Saviour thought good, for brevity-ſake, to propound this argument to them by way of queſtion, and ſo let them reaſon it out within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet it was as forcible, they plainly felt, as if he had pleaded with them in this manner. My Authority, which you call in queſtion, is every evident. I have it from Heaven, and not from Men; as I prove by this argument. If the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of <hi>John</hi> be from Heaven, then from thence I come; now you cannot deny, if you will ſpeak out, that his Baptiſm is from thence; and therefore I make the concluſion, that my Authority is Divine. The conſequence was as clear as the Sun, that if <hi>John</hi> was ſent by God, then ſo was <hi>Jeſus</hi> in that quality wherein he appeared; becauſe <hi>John</hi> (as you ſhall ſee) gave this teſtimony to him, which could not be queſtioned after they had granted him to be a Prophet. The only thing that could be denied in this Argument was, that <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm was from Heaven; or that God authorized him to ſay and do what he did. But this they durſt not oppoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then to rid themſelves of one Enemy, they ſhould bring the whole Nation, as we ſay, about their ears: who did not take <hi>John</hi> for a counterfeit, but thought,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:204181:154"/>
                           <hi>that he was a Prophet INDEED,</hi> xi. <hi>Mark</hi> 32. Nay, they themſelves never adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to call <hi>John</hi> before their Council; much leſs adviſed how they might put him to death, as they did our Saviour. But on the contrary, <hi>many of the Phariſees and the Sadducees came to his Baptiſm,</hi> iii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. They were as inclinable to reverence him as the people. For God who had ſpoken heretofore to that Nation ſo long by <hi>Prophets,</hi> whom they thought themſelves bound to believe, had plainly manifeſted him to be one. Nay, he was not a common Prophet, but one of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary rank: <hi>The Prophet of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> his Father calls him; and <hi>more than a Prophet</hi> in the language of our Saviour, as you ſhall hear preſently.</p>
                        <p>What ſhould they do then? which way ſhould they turn themſelves, now that they durſt not deny the Propoſition, upon which this conſequence evidently depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Their only reſuge was ſilence: For though thereby they acknowledged him too hard for them, and ſuffered his Divine authority to ſtand ſupported by this unanſwered Argument; yet they had rather part ſo, and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully break off the diſputation which they
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:204181:154"/>themſelves had begun, than let him go away with their expreſs confeſſion and teſtimony, that, if the Prophet of the Higheſt might be believed, he was <hi>their Chriſt.</hi> It was no diſadvantage to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but to their own cauſe, that they anſwered, <hi>they could not tell</hi> whence <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm was: For hereby it appeared He had ſo much to ſay for himſelf, that if they would ſay any thing in this matter, and not obſtinately hold their peace, they muſt ſay as He did, that He was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> For <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, whoſe Heavenly authority they durſt not deny, though they would not confeſs it, received all men into this belief when they came to him, that there was one COMING <hi>after him,</hi> who ſhould gather Diſciples as he did, and that he was <hi>the Chriſt.</hi> This he told them was the very end of his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Baptizing, <hi>to prepare the way of the Lord;</hi> to make them fit and ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the next Prophet that ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as greater than him, even as <hi>the Son of God.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Jeſus</hi> did openly appear and come to his Baptiſm, and <hi>John</hi> ſaw the Spirit deſcend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main on <hi>him,</hi> then he told them in plain terms that <hi>this</hi> was the perſon whoſe way he came to prepare, and that they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:204181:155"/>
                           <hi>him</hi> as the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and <hi>the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> i. <hi>John</hi> 29, 30, 34. And that which he ſaid at this time, there is no doubt he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared at all times, when the people came to be baptized. For thus the <hi>Jews</hi> deſcribe <hi>Jeſus</hi> when they diſputed with ſome of <hi>John</hi>'s Scholars about his Baptiſm, iii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 25. HE TO WHOM THOU BA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REST WITNESS, <hi>behold, the ſame bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. Thence he is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called one of his WITNESSES, and ſaid to come for this end, that he might be a WITNESS to him, <hi>that ALL men through him might believe;</hi> that is, might be perſwaded that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>WORD of God,</hi> by this teſtimony of <hi>John,</hi> i. <hi>John</hi> 6, 7, 8. And our Saviour afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to this Teſtimony of his, and bids the <hi>Jews</hi> conſider it, v. <hi>John</hi> 32, 33. For you know, ſays he, that he bare WIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS to me, when ye ſent to him: <hi>And I know that the WITNESS which he WIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESSETH of me is true.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And great reaſon there was that they ſhould conſider it, and be convinced by it. For <hi>John was a burning and a ſhining light</hi> (as it there follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 35.) and they <hi>themſelves were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoyce
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:204181:155"/>in his light.</hi> If that fit was over, and now they were leſs delighted in him, it was merely becauſe he teſtified of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> There was nothing elſe to damp their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; for otherways they could not but confeſs him to be an illuſtrious perſon. Who ſhined with the greater ſplendour, becauſe He was miraculouſly conceived in his Mothers old Age; and his Birth was predicted by an Angel; and his Father ſtruck dumb becauſe he believed not his Word; and this Angel appeared in the very Temple, at the Altar of Incenſe, and therefore was not like to be a deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And his Father was indued with the Spirit of Prophecy, and his tongue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſed when this Child came to be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed; Then He ſpake concerning his quality, by the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt; and <hi>John</hi> appeared to be prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically endowed from a child; God alſo took care of his education in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where he was trained up to a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of <hi>Elias;</hi> ſo that his life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners tranſcended all in that Age; and his Spirit and Doctrine was ſo powerful and convincing, that it was hard for them to ſay who he was; the people admiring his ſanctity and preaching, held him for a Prophet; and ſome of the Prieſts and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:204181:156"/>Levites having ſuch an eſteem of him, that it was a queſtion among them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was not the CHRIST.</p>
                        <p>They were ſent, you know, from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to enquire about it, i. <hi>John</hi> 19, 20, &amp;c. and yet this Perſon, who ſhined with ſuch a luſtre, whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf calls the greateſt that had been born of women, of whom he was baptized; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to theſe perſons who came to ask who he was, that he was not worthy ſo much as to carry the Shooes of him that was <hi>coming</hi> after him, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. and that his Doctrine, as you have heard (iii. 31.) was of <hi>the Earth,</hi> flat and low in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with the words that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould ſpeak; who he told them plainly was the Chriſt, the Son of God: but as for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>he confeſſed, and denied not; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed</hi> (that is, repeated it more than once, and affirmed conſtantly) <hi>I am not the Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What reaſon was there then, why both they that heard his teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and they that ſent theſe meſſengers to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, ſhould not believe him, ſince all this was ſo known a truth? His Father <hi>Zacharias</hi> was a Prieſt, whom they could
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:204181:156"/>not but reverence more than to imagine he ſtudied to deceive, eſpecially ſince he was noted for a righteous man, <hi>walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameleſs.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> himſelf was a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> one whoſe head was never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the fumes of Wine or of ſtrong drink: (i. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.) and bred up like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the <hi>Deſarts</hi> or Wilderneſs of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> (i. <hi>Luke</hi> 80.) after a plain and ſimple faſhion; where he was like to learn no craft or guile. If any body ſhould take the confidence to fancy that there might be a compact between <hi>Jeſus</hi> and him, to cry up and ſpeak great things of one another: He is confuted by the plain ſtory of both their lives. I have told you how far <hi>Jeſus</hi> was from ſeeking his own glory; and <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt was a man of ſuch confeſſed ſanctity and ſevere vertue, that none then could ſuſpect him of ſuch a guilt. Beſides that it is manifeſt they never had ſeen one another, at leaſt <hi>John</hi> had no knowledge of our Saviour, until He came to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed of him: when he immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed him to be that perſon whom he had magnified ſo much, and told them ſhould be preferred above himſelf, before he had any ſuch acquaintance with him. And it is not unfit to be remembred, that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:204181:157"/>even before he was born, <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt leaped in his Mothers womb, when the bleſſed Virgin came to viſit her; as if he had then begun to confeſs him to be the LORD (as his Mother calls him, i. <hi>Luke</hi> 41, 43.) and to rejoyce to be a WIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS unto ſo great a perſon.</p>
                        <p>For a concluſion of this, let the place be noted where <hi>Jeſus</hi> came to be baptized of <hi>John;</hi> and where he gave ſo ample a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to him: For from thence we ſhall draw ſomething, which will help to ſettle this belief in us, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Son of God. It was at BETHABARA <hi>beyond Jordan,</hi> as S. <hi>John</hi> has recorded, i. <hi>John</hi> 28. There the Prieſts and Levites, who were deputed by the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or great Council at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to go and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him, received their Anſwer from him again and again, that he was not the CHRIST: For there he was baptizing, and there <hi>Jeſus</hi> came to receive his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; for as he was ſpeaking thoſe words which you read <hi>ver.</hi> 27. and ſaying he was <hi>not worthy to looſe the latchet of his Shooes; Jeſus came from Galilee</hi> (as S. <hi>Matthew</hi> writes, iii. 13.) <hi>to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</hi> Now this Name BETHABARA ſignifies the <hi>place of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,</hi>

                        <p>And it is obſervable, that to this place our Saviour a great while after returned again, and there made his reſidence, when the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſought to kill him, x. <hi>John</hi> 40. I cannot but think that this Evangeliſt would have us learn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from his ſo particular remembrance of this place, both at our Saviours bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and at his return again into the Country beyond <hi>Jordan.</hi> For it is not their manner to mention ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in ſo ſhort a Hiſtory as this is, without ſome conſiderable reaſon. Now as we have gueſſed at the cauſe of his being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and receiving the teſtimony of <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Bethabara;</hi> ſo it is likely the reaſon why our Saviour went hither again and here <hi>abode</hi> was, that he might call to the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:204181:158"/>peoples mind what had been done here formerly; the Teſtimony which <hi>John</hi> received from God concerning him, and the Teſtimony which thereupon <hi>John</hi> gave to them of him, at this remarkable place. For he knew <hi>thoſe things which were done at Bethabara,</hi> had a great force in them to work a much better diſpoſition in the people, than was in the murderous hearts of thoſe at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to move them to become his Diſciples. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which ſuppoſition you read in the very next words (x. <hi>John</hi> 41, 42.) that many reſorting to him, began to diſcourſe among themſelves concerning <hi>John,</hi> and of what he had ſpoken concerning our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (for which we can find no occaſion but the place, and perhaps our Saviours putting them in mind what had been ſaid and done here) and that <hi>many believed on him THERE.</hi> The word <hi>there</hi> is to be remarked; for it tells us that theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples were won to <hi>Jeſus</hi> at that place, where <hi>John at firſt baptized.</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, it is probable, what he had ſaid; how he told them, that he ſaw the Holy Ghoſt here deſcend and remain upon him, and that this was he whom he had ſpoken of before who was greater than himſelf, and that he <hi>ſaw and bare record
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:204181:159"/>that this is the Son of God.</hi> And they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe now beheld ſome <hi>miracles</hi> wrought by our Saviour (whereas <hi>John</hi> wrought none) which proved <hi>John</hi>'s words to be <hi>true which he ſpake of him,</hi> that he ſhould be <hi>preferred before him:</hi> be the true <hi>Joſhua</hi> whom they muſt all follow, the Meſſiah, the KING of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whoſe conduct they muſt truſt, if they meant to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reſt.</p>
                        <p>I have done with the <hi>firſt</hi> BAPTISM, that of <hi>John;</hi> which if you conſider throughly, the Perſon from whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> received it, the place where he went into the water, the teſtimony that was here given him, both by the <hi>Father,</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and by <hi>John;</hi> you will eaſily grant it might well be affirmed in reſpect to all theſe, that <hi>he came by WATER,</hi> and that this was one of his WITNES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. It is time now to come to the <hi>ſecond</hi> particular, and take into conſideration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while his OWN BAPTISM which he adminiſtred: For that is not without ſome proof, that he was the CHRIST. Indeed <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf baptized not, but his Diſciples, as you read, iv. <hi>John</hi> 2. But
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:204181:159"/>yet becauſe whatſoever a Servant doth by the authority of his Maſter, it is reputed the Maſters Act, and he himſelf is ſaid to do it; therefore <hi>Jeſus</hi> alſo is ſaid to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in the ſame Evangeliſt, iii. 26. iv. 1. Now this was an argument to the <hi>Jews</hi> that he was the Meſſiah.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Firſt, becauſe all expected that the Meſſiah or CHRIST ſhould come with <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and thereby <hi>renew the world,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſometime ſpeak. It began they ſay in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he brought them to receive the Law from God, and entred them by this Ceremony of waſhing into a new Religion, xix. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 10, 14. By which they tell us, <hi>Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes</hi> were received into their communion in ſucceeding times; when they paſſed from the ſtate of <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated to worſhip God with the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites.</hi> And therefore when CHRIST came, and with him a <hi>new world</hi> (for there is nothing more common in their Books than to call his days, The WORLD TO COME) they concluded he ſhould begin it with <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did that frame of things which he erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="294" facs="tcp:204181:160"/>This is certain, it was one of their marks of him, that in his days there ſhould be an univerſal Baptiſm and cleanſing of the people. Which they gather from xiii. <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. where we read of a <hi>FOUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN opened for ſin and for uncleanneſs:</hi> and from ſeveral places in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where he ſpeaks of the <hi>Waters in the wilderneſs</hi> (in which S. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us <hi>John baptized,</hi> i. 4.) and from the xxxvi. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25. where he ſays, <hi>I will ſprinkle Water upon you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a new heart alſo will I give you:</hi> which is applied by the Apoſtles to the days of Chriſt, who began his new Kingdom with <hi>waſhing with Water</hi> or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in his name. And therefore when <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt came with this Water, they ſent, as I noted before, to know of him who he was, thinking he might be <hi>the Chriſt.</hi> For which there appears no reaſon (for he did not work ſo much as one miracle) but that <hi>all Judea, and all the region about Jordan went out to him, and were BAPTIZED of him in Jordan confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ſins,</hi> iii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5, 6. And therefore when He told them that he was not the CHRIST, nor <hi>Elias,</hi> nor that <hi>other Prophet;</hi> whom they expected to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, they ask him then, i. <hi>John</hi> 25. <hi>Why BAPTIZEST thou,</hi> if thou art
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:204181:160"/>none of theſe? They thought it was not in the power of any man to inſtitute and introduce this new Ceremony, unleſs he was either <hi>the CHRIST</hi> or his <hi>Forerunner,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Prophet</hi> (<hi>Jeremiah</hi> it is like) who they fanſied ſhould riſe from the dead and come along with him. A <hi>new</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony I call it, becauſe though we ſhould grant that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was in uſe among them (as much hath been ſaid by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de Jure Nat. &amp; L. de Succeſſion.</note> among others to prove it) yet thereby they only received Proſelytes and their children from other Countries. But it was not the manner to baptize <hi>Jews,</hi> ſuch as were grown and adult; much leſs did any of the Maſters in <hi>Iſrael</hi> gather Diſciples after this faſhion; and therefore the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim</hi> might well ſend to enquire who this was, that took upon him to call all the Country to repent, and ſanctifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and alſo like a Prophet had parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſcholars miniſtring unto him.</p>
                        <p>The moſt learned of the <hi>Jews</hi> indeed had but confuſed notions of things to come, and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> you ſee here by their queſtions, did not certainly know whether Baptizing with ſuch an authority, was a ſign that a man was the Chriſt or not: yet they generally inclined
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:204181:161"/>to believe that it was a note of him, as may be gathered, I think, from iii. <hi>Luke</hi> 15. where you read that <hi>the people were in expectation</hi> (knew not what to think, but waited that <hi>John</hi> would declare <hi>the Chriſt</hi> to them) <hi>and ALL MEN muſed in their hearts of John,</hi> that is, <hi>debated</hi> and <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> within themſelves (as it is in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) whether <hi>John</hi> would at laſt declare himſelf to be <hi>the Chriſt</hi> or not. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Argument there is to prove that they lookt upon <hi>Baptiſm</hi> as a mark of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah;</hi> for as ſoon as our Saviour began to make this his buſineſs, and to authorize his Diſciples to baptize, then they were more <hi>in ſuſpenſe</hi> (as that word <hi>expectation</hi> in S. <hi>Luke</hi> now mentioned may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred) than ever: And knew not what to imagine, when they ſaw two great men doing one and the ſame thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by drawing the people after them. But after they had debated the matter better, it ſeems they began to leave their opinion of <hi>John</hi>'s being the Meſſiah, and to look rather upon <hi>Jeſus</hi> as the perſon; at leaſt to have ſome thoughts that it might be ſo.</p>
                        <p>For we find in iii. <hi>John</hi> 25. that there aroſe a controverſie between ſome of <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples and ſome <hi>Jews</hi> who were not his
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:204181:161"/>Diſciples, <hi>about purifying or cleanſing:</hi> by which may be underſtood <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which was the ſign and the inſtrument of it. And the diſpute (as far as the following diſcourſe directs our conjectures) was this, Whether their Maſter <hi>John</hi>'s Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or that of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the beſt, and which of them a <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould receive? For they ſaw them both baptiſe, <hi>Jeſus in Judea, ver.</hi> 22. and <hi>John, in Enon near to Sabim, ver.</hi> 23. To which of theſe places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould reſort ſeems to be the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. If <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſm was from Heaven, why ſhould it be laid aſide, or why ſhould another come and take his work out of his hand? Was <hi>Jeſus</hi> now ſent with a greater authority, ſo that they muſt leave <hi>John,</hi> and go to him? To this his Diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to give no ſatisfaction, they go to the Maſter himſelf for a reſolution, and tell him, <hi>Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan to whom thou bareſt witneſs, behold, the ſame baptizeth, and all men come to him.</hi> As much as to ſay, we are much perplexed, being in doubt which of you two to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for our Maſter. For <hi>Jeſus</hi> who was <hi>baptized of thee at Bethabara</hi> (a note they imagined of his inferiority to <hi>John</hi>) and yet had a teſtimony from thy ſelf that he was ſent of God too; does not only now
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:204181:162"/>take upon him thy office, and thereby leſſen and extenuate thy authority, but quite eclipſes and obſcures thee, baptizing far more than thou doſt. Which ſhows that they began to conceive <hi>John</hi> was not the man they had taken him for; but that <hi>Jeſus</hi> rather ſhould enjoy that name which they had been apt hitherto to beſtow upon him: and their Argument was, becauſe <hi>Jeſus</hi> baptized more Diſciples than the other did.</p>
                        <p>To this <hi>John</hi> anſwers in the next words, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>A man can receive</hi> (or take unto himſelf) <hi>nothing, except it be given him from Heaven.</hi> That is, let not this trouble you, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> Baptizes, and all come to him; it is no more than I told you, that I was no body in compariſon with him. For no man can honeſtly aſſume more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to himſelf than his Commiſſion gives him. And for that reaſon I could not do ſo much as <hi>Jeſus</hi> does, becauſe I have not received ſo much, nor can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo large a power from God, who alone can give it. And then he adds, that it is ſtrange they ſhould forget what he had told them in expreſs words, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>Ye your ſelves bear me witneſs, that I ſaid, I AM NOT THE CHRIST, but that I
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:204181:162"/>am ſent before him.</hi> That is, it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you raiſe this diſpute, when I never gave you any occaſion to fancy me to be as great as he; but told you plainly, as you your ſelves may remember, that I was not your KING anointed by God to rule over you; all the honour that I had being no more than this, to be ordered to come and prepare his way for him. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended that my waſhing you with Water, or gathering Diſciples, ſhould be a mark that I was the CHRIST: Alas! I only baptized you with the water of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that you might be diſpoſed to believe on him, who I told you was <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> To whom you would do well, now that he is come, to go and be baptized of him. For he brings a nobler baptiſm than that of mine, being as much above me as the Bridegroom at a wedding is above him who only waits upon him, and prepares things belonging to the marriage. That's the ſence of the 30. <hi>verſe.</hi> I never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet up my ſelf as the Principal perſon in this buſineſs, that we are come about. For I know very well, that <hi>he who hath the bride, is the bridegroom,</hi> that is, he is the Head of the Church or people of God, to whom God hath deſigned that high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And that is <hi>Jeſus,</hi> not I, who am
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:204181:163"/>only <hi>his Friend,</hi> ſent before to make things ready for him. It is a great honour for me to be one of his Diſciples, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his inſtructions. And I am glad with all my heart that I live to hear him preach. It is an exceeding great pleaſure to me, all the joy I can deſire, to hear him, the Bridegroom ſpeaking to his Bride the Church, and telling her him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf what he intends to do for her, and what he would have her to do. Queſtion no more therefore to whom you ſhould go for purifying from your ſins, nor think it ſtrange that he Baptizes more than I. For <hi>He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe, ver.</hi> 30. There remains now nothing for me to do; but I muſt be obſcure, as <hi>Theophylact</hi> gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, like the day-Star when the Sun ariſes. All muſt become his Diſciples, even they who now are mine, and I my ſelf too, as in truth I am. For he ſays, the Friend of the Bridegroom, that is, himſelf, <hi>standeth</hi> (which was the poſture of a Scholar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Maſter) <hi>and heareth him, rejoycing greatly becauſe of his voice,</hi> that is, becauſe he is come to teach, who could do it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than himſelf. For there is as much difference, he preſently adds in the next words, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. (which I have explained before) between their two doctrines, as
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:204181:163"/>there is between the Heaven and the Earth. And therefore they muſt needs be inexcuſable who did not <hi>receive his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 32.) and become his Diſciples. Who came with ſuch authority from God (<hi>ver.</hi> 33.) and had not the Spirit by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (<hi>ver.</hi> 34.) but the power to reveal the whole will of God, and do all his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (<hi>ver.</hi> 35.) For, as he concludes, <hi>everlaſting life</hi> is the portion of him who believeth on <hi>Jeſus:</hi> but if a man believe not, <hi>he ſhall never ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee <hi>John</hi> himſelf directs them again unto <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and bids them go to his Baptiſm, become his Diſciples, and no longer doubt whether he was the Chriſt or not. For as he did not pretend to an equality with <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſo they ſhould ſee his fame continually decline and grow leſs, by the growth of the Glory of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who ſhould ſhine alone by himſelf, and quite darken him. So <hi>Gregory</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Hom.</hi> 20. <hi>in Evang.</hi>
                           </note> the Great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds thoſe words now mentioned (<hi>ver.</hi> 30.) <hi>He muſt increaſe, and I muſt decreaſe;</hi> the ſence of which he ſeems to have hit better than any that I have ſeen, when he ſays: <hi>In what was John diminiſhed, and our Saviour advanced but in this: that the people
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:204181:164"/>ſeeing the abſtinence of John, and his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the ſociety of the world, imagined him to be the Chriſt; whereas our Saviour, whom they beheld eating with Publicans, and keeping the company of ſinners, they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied was not the Chriſt, but only a Prophet? But when in proceſs of time, both Jeſus who was taken for a Prophet, appeared to be the Chriſt; and John who was taken for the Chriſt, was diſcovered to be but a Prophet: then was fulfilled what he had foretold, He muſt increaſe and I muſt decreaſe. For both our Saviour increaſed in the eſteem of the people, becauſe he was acknowledged to be what he was; and John decreaſed, becauſe he ceaſed to be called what he was not.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. And this leads me to the next conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which I ſhall but briefly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That as <hi>John</hi> directed them to prefer our Saviours <hi>Baptiſm</hi> before his, and to become the Diſciples of a far greater Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: ſo the end of the Baptiſm of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was to entertain men for his Diſciples, that thereby they might make profeſſion of their belief in him. And here now our Saviour began to eclipſe the luſtre of <hi>John,</hi> and ſhowed himſelf much ſuperiour to him: both in that he did not adminiſter <hi>Baptiſm</hi> himſelf by his own hands, as <hi>John</hi>
                           <pb n="303" facs="tcp:204181:164"/>did, but appointed his Diſciples to do it, who thereby became equal with <hi>John;</hi> and that he gathered Diſciples to <hi>himſelf,</hi> whereas <hi>John</hi> Baptized them into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of him that was to come after him, as you read expreſly, xix. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. None I ſuppoſe can doubt of this, but that they who received baptiſm from our Saviour's Diſciples, who waited conſtantly upon him, did thereby own <hi>Jeſus</hi> for <hi>a Teacher</hi> or Maſter <hi>ſent of God</hi> (as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſpeaks, iii. <hi>John</hi> 2.) and conſequently profeſſed themſelves deſirous to learn of him, and ready to believe what he taught. But I cannot ſay that they baptized them now into the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or into a belief that he was <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> as they did after his aſcenſion into Heaven. For they were forbid to publiſh this openly, xvi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. men were to learn it by degrees under his diſcipline, to which they delivered themſelves by being baptized of him. Yet this prepared them for the belief that he was their <hi>Chriſt:</hi> which his Apoſtles afterward moſt zealouſly and ſtrongly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by Baptiſm. For when he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted at Gods right hand, they went, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Commiſſion, and <hi>Diſcipled all Nations,</hi> baptizing them into his name, as well as into the name of the Father.

For what greater mark could there be of ſupreme authority, than the ſetting up, in ſuch a manner as he did; an Inſtitution and Diſcipline which was not known before; and teaching thoſe who received his baptiſm, to obſerve a new Law, without thoſe rites which had been hitherto uſed? Who could repeal the Ordinances of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nay, abrogate Circumciſion, which was ancienter than <hi>Moſes;</hi> but only He who had the ſame power with him that gave the Law to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and Circumciſion to <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father, <hi>viz.</hi> the Son of God himſelf?

And he plainly declared, as you read in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that no man could have any part in that Kingdom, which the Meſſiah was ſetting up in the world, if he contented himſelf with the old Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and were not <hi>by baptiſm born again;</hi> that is, ſuffered himſelf to be further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and proceeded to entertain the Religion which he delivered.

For to avoid their rage which they had conceived againſt <hi>him</hi> upon this account, but never expreſſed againſt <hi>John, he left Judea</hi> (where he was baptizing, as you heard before, iii. 22.) becauſe they had great power there, and <hi>departed into Galilee again,</hi> where their authority was leſs, iv. 1, 2, 3.

                        <p>I wiſh that every one who conſiders how great and neceſſary a proof this was, of <hi>Jeſus</hi> his being the Son of God, would labour to prove himſelf to be indeed born of him by the ſame argument of purity and holineſs.

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:204181:167"/>that he is one of thoſe whom he will own for his children, unleſs he conform to his holy will, by waſhing himſelf from all filthineſs, and becoming clean every whit. Read over the Sermons and the Life of Chriſt, and remember that your Baptiſm engages you to learn of him, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like him. Expreſs that Honour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, that Fear and that Love of him which he requires. Imploy your ſelves carefully in all actions of Juſtice, Charity, and Sobriety. Yea, be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red chearfully to follow him, in ſuffering as well as in doing his bleſſed will. This will be an infallible teſtimony, that you are the children of God; as, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if you want this Witneſs, all other evidence of it will fail you. There is no reaſon to diſtruſt this; but the ſtronger your confidence is without it, the more groſly you deceive your ſelves, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude your ſelves to be dear to him. You find both theſe ſtrongly aſſerted in this Epiſtle. For the Affirmative read, ii. 29. <hi>If ye know that he is righteous, know ye that every one that doth righteouſneſs is born of him.</hi> And iii. 7. <hi>Little children, let no man deceive you; he that doth righteouſneſs, is righteous, even as he is righteous.</hi> For the Negative, read the following words,

                           <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9, 10. <hi>He that committeth ſin, is of the Devil; for the Devil ſinneth from the beginning. For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil. Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin; for his ſeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him; and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God. In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs, is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Brother.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And for your encouragement to purifie your Souls, remember that the purity and holineſs of Chriſt's Life and Doctrine, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures you of the truth of all his gracious promiſes. We may ſay with a greater aſſurance than the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> did in his days (xii. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.) <hi>The words of the Lord</hi> (i. e. his promiſes) <hi>are pure words; as ſilver tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a furnace of Earth, purified ſeven times.</hi> Which ſhould make us value them more than <hi>thouſands of Gold and Silver,</hi> though never ſo perfectly refined; and to ſay as he does in another place, cxix. 140. <hi>Thy word is very pure, therefore thy ſervant loveth it.</hi> Thoſe Metals are not freer from Droſs, after they have paſſed never ſo oft through the Fining-pot, than his promiſes
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:204181:168"/>are from all mixture of deceit. We may rely upon them with the greateſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and be ſecure they will never fail us. It is as certainly true, that God will take us to be his Sons and Daughters, that he will <hi>dwell in</hi> us, and give us everlaſting life, as it is, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Son of God. He that ſays the one, ſays the other too: and he may be alike believed in both.</p>
                        <p>But then, <hi>having theſe promiſes, we muſt cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 1.

                     <p>COME we now to hear what the next <hi>Witneſs</hi> ſays, which we ſhall find to give in an Evidence as ſtrong as the former, and that is <hi>the BLOUD.</hi> By this word every body preſently underſtands the <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>DEATH</hi> of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> when his <hi>Bloud,</hi> you know, was ſhed upon the Croſs, in a moſt ignominious manner. For that envy which began to riſe in the <hi>Phariſees</hi> hearts (as I obſerved in the end of the foregoing Chapter, from iv. <hi>John</hi> 1.) when they ſaw him baptize ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples; never ceaſed boiling till it turned into perfect Gall, and the rankeſt hatred and malice in the World: which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfied till they had <hi>baptized him</hi> (as S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks, xii. 50.) with his own
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:204181:172"/>bloud. For the preſent indeed, as you read there and in many other places, he avoided their ſnares, and went out of their way when he thought they intended to apprehend him, becauſe he would preſerve himſelf till he had preached all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try over. But when that was done, he ſuffered them to take him at a publick feaſt, and delivering up himſelf into their hands, let them do with him juſt as their murderous malice inclined them.</p>
                     <p>Now this voluntary Oblation and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himſelf to ſuffer what they pleaſed to inflict, was ſuch an evidence, that in truth he was the Son of God, as he had made his diſciples believe, that there is a particular mark ſet upon it, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, both by himſelf and by his Apoſtles. He himſelf, in his diſcourſe with <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> juſt before his crucifixion, and when he ſtood before him condemned by the <hi>Jews,</hi> for ſaying he was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> expreſly affirms, that <hi>for this end he was born, and therefore he came into the world, that he might bear witneſs to the truth,</hi> xviii. <hi>John</hi> 37. Which was as much as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that he had rather die than loſe the end for which he had lived thus long; which was, to ſpeak the Truth, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:204181:172"/>this Truth, that he was indeed a KING (as you there read) the very Son of God. This was the thing he would juſtifie, whatſoever he ſuffered for it. God had appointed him to ſeal this with his death, and to atteſt it in the moſt ſolemn manner, even before his Judge here on Earth, and when he was going to be judged by God; and therefore he would not for all the world deny it, or not confeſs it. We ordinarily ſay, when we would affirm any thing very ſtrongly, that if it was the laſt thing that ever we ſhould ſpeak, we would not ſtick to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. And juſt ſo did our Saviour; I came, ſays he, into the world for this end, to <hi>bear witneſs to the truth,</hi> and here I take it upon my death that I do not ſwerve from it in the leaſt, when I ſay, that I am the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, as I have noted already, takes particular notice of this, when he remembers <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 vi. 13. how <hi>Jeſus did WITNESS a good confeſſion before Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate.</hi> That is, aſſerted this Truth, that he was a KING, though not of this world, by confeſſing it before him, who ſate in judgment upon him, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger of his life. He durſt not
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:204181:173"/>retract any thing which he knew to be a truth, though he knew withall it would prove ſo coſtly, that he muſt defend it with his <hi>bloud.</hi> He ſtood in this to the very laſt, that he was the CHRIST, and durſt not to ſave ſuch a precious life ſpeak one word otherwiſe: for then he knew that he ſhould have been a lyar, like the <hi>Jews</hi> who denied it.</p>
                     <p>This that hath been thus premiſed to the following diſcourſe, is very ſerviceable to the demonſtrating what a Witneſs his BLOUD was: becauſe it calls to mind that which is neceſſary to be here again conſidered, how he loſt his life for nothing elſe, but merely becauſe he confeſſed that he was <hi>their CHRIST, the Son of the Bleſſed.</hi> Many cauſes of death were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly ſought for, and ſundry falſe witneſſes boldly roſe up againſt him; and yet none of their teſtimonies, when they came to be ſcan'd, were found to be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (as S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s expreſſion is, xiv. 56, 59.) <hi>equal</hi> to the endictment or charge that was brought againſt him, and to the intended judgment which was to paſs upon him. There was nothing ponderous enough, of ſufficient weight to juſtifie ſuch a ſentence as that of death, which they were deſirous
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:204181:173"/>to pronounce upon him: and therefore they deſpaired of attaining their end, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they could have ſuch words out of his own mouth, as in their opinion would prove him a blaſphemer; for which they might juſtly condemn him. <hi>Which of you</hi> (ſays he himſelf, viii. <hi>John</hi> 46.) <hi>convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth me of ſin?</hi> No, when they muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove <hi>him</hi> a ſinner, or <hi>themſelves</hi> for apprehending him without a cauſe; they were not able, no, not by the help of a great ſin, in bringing falſe witneſſes into open Court, to faſten any crime upon him, which would touch his life. All that they could find to warrant a ſentence ſo heavy, was nothing but what they got out of his own mouth; by adjuring him in the name of God, to tell them whether he were <hi>the CHRIST.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His affirming this was the thing for which he was adjudged by the great Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſuffer death. This was the only truth they told <hi>Pilate,</hi> when they brought him into his Court, that <hi>he made himſelf CHRIST, a KING,</hi> xxiii. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. xix. <hi>John</hi> 7. This was the inſcription over his head, the Title upon the Croſs, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS, xxiii. <hi>Luke</hi> 38. This was
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:204181:174"/>the thing they ſcoffed at, after they had condemned him themſelves, xxvi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 68. and which they taught the ſouldiers to mock him withall, after he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>Pilate,</hi> xv. <hi>Mark</hi> 18. and which the Chief Prieſt, with the Scribes and Elders, made the ſubject of their taunts and jeers, as he hung upon the Croſs, xxvii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 40, 41, 42, 43. Read all theſe places, and you will ſee, that the aſſerting of this being the cauſe of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and ſhame, S. <hi>John</hi> had reaſon to alledge his BLOUD as a great evidence or <hi>Witneſs</hi> to this Truth.</p>
                     <p>Now that the ſtrength of its teſtimony may the better appear, let theſe things following be diſtinctly conſidered.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that <hi>Bloud</hi> is the life of every living Creature; and therefore the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of this is the loſing of ones life. It is not only a frequent Precept in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they ſhould not eat the <hi>bloud,</hi> becauſe it was the life of the Beaſt; but common obſervation teaches us, that it is the Vehicle or Chariot wherein the Spirits ride their Circuit round the Body; and that if it loſe its way and run out of the Body, all motion ceaſes, the Spirits flying away together with it.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="323" facs="tcp:204181:174"/>II. Conſider then further, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo ſweet as Life, and that of all other things we naturally moſt abhor death. All that we eat and drink is to prevent it; and men are too much incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to do unworthy things to eſcape it, becauſe it robs us of all our enjoyments here, though never ſo near to us. <hi>Skin upon skin</hi> (ſays he who <hi>hath the power of death,</hi> ii. <hi>Job</hi> 4.) one skin after another, though it be never ſo tender and delicate, and never ſo painful to part with it, <hi>Yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. Life therefore being a thing ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and deſirable, and Death ſo diſmal and affrightful; no man ſure in his perfect health and perfect wits, will be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to part with the one and run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the other, for a mere fancy by which he received no benefit at all while he lived, and can hope for none when he is dead. What rational man is there (as our Saviour appears to be by all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and actions) who knows the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of Life; who that is not in a frenzy (the leaſt ſpice of which is not diſcernible in him) will chuſe to part with his life,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:204181:175"/>and ſo part with all his Friends, who are infinitely deſirous of his company; when he may innocently ſave it, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enjoy thoſe lovers, friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and all other things which he muſt leave by dying? Ask your ſelves, (that's the beſt way) is Life ſuch a trifle, that any of you are inclined to throw it away in a mere humour? Is it ſo contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible, that a ſerious man and one that need not be miſerable, will ſtudiouſly loſe it, only to be talkt of? Nay, would any of you take the moſt cruel pains and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in your way to Death, and paſs out of the world with all the diſgrace imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, merely becauſe you will? when it is as much in your power to free your ſelves from them all, and to live in pleaſure, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and good repute among your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours?</p>
                     <p n="4">VI. Much leſs would any man, that is not beſide himſelf, die for a lye. Death being uncomfortable in it ſelf, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtill more diſmal if it ſhould be for that which we ſaw proved an <hi>untruth;</hi> but moſt of all black and dreadful if it muſt be endured for <hi>a lye;</hi> that is, for ſuch an untruth as we had deviſed our ſelves, and knew to be a falſity; and whereby we
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:204181:175"/>intended to deceive, and might have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen whether we would have told it or no. If any man ſhould be tempted to tell a lye, yet what ſhould tempt him to endure the rack, yea to ſuffer death for it; when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He nor any man elſe ſhall get any thing by it, and he might live far more honourably by telling the truth? Make your ſelves Judges, and enquire of your own minds, whether you can think of any thing that hath ſuch a power of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in it. No, no, we all love life better than ſo. When a man will give all that he hath for it (as the Tempter himſelf ſaid) it were very ſtrange if he ſhould not part with a vain lye, that he might enjoy it.</p>
                     <p>And therefore the Apoſtle here bids us conſider this, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> CAME not <hi>by WATER only,</hi> but <hi>by Water and BLOUD.</hi> That is, He did not only <hi>preach</hi> this, and by his holy <hi>Life</hi> juſtifie his integrity in what he ſaid, but He <hi>died</hi> to atteſt this, and make it good. If the WATER be not enough to perſwade us that he did not falſifie, yet the <hi>Water</hi> and BLOUD toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are ſufficient to confirm us in a ſtrong belief of his ſincerity. For ſhould the tongue of an honeſt man chance to ſlip,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:204181:176"/>and to ſpeak on a ſudden what he knew to be falſe, yet he would never be ſuch a fool and a villain too, as to die to make it good: whereas <hi>Jeſus</hi> both ſaid and took it upon his death, that he was Gods Son; in neither of which ſuch a perſon as he could poſſibly deſign to deceive us. He was not ſo ſhallow but he could eaſily ſee that a lye would ſometime or other be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; for all men naturally hate it, and, when they have any ſuſpicion, can never be at reſt till they have diſcovered it. And therefore if he propoſed to himſelf glory and honour, fame and a great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation after a ſhameful death, he could never be ſecure that he ſhould win it, but rather had juſt cauſe to fear the forgery would be detected: And then it would have proved a greater blot upon him, and more reproached his name, that he was a wilful obſtinate Lyar, than the Croſs or Gibbet, the buffetings, ſpittings, cruel mockings, and all the other indignities that he endured. This would have branded him with eternal infamy, and have made his name ſtink throughout the world. Nothing could have ſtigmatized him like this (unleſs it had been the mark of folly added to that of inſincerity) that he was a ſhameleſs deceiver. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:204181:176"/>I conclude that he would <hi>have witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a good confeſſion</hi> by denying all that he had ſaid concerning his being the <hi>Son of God;</hi> if he had not known aſſuredly that he had ſaid nothing but that great Truth, which muſt not be denied, whatſoever miſeries and diſgraces it coſt him to make it good.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. And this truly is much to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that if he had been wont to cheat and ſpeak falſely, there could not have been a more ſeaſonable time to make uſe of ſome lye, than now that it would coſt him his life to aſſert this, which, no doubt, he took for a truth. If he would but have denied this one thing, and ſaid that he was not the Son of God; all their malice, as I ſaid, could not have found a crime great enough to warrant the taking away of his life according to their Law. And therefore ſuppoſing him an Impoſtor and deceiver, as the <hi>Jews</hi> called him, he muſt be a very ſilly one, who would not now make uſe of his art to ſave himſelf; when that one little word <hi>NO</hi> would have done it, in anſwer to the queſtion, that the High Prieſt put to him. For what reaſon can be imagined why he ſhould now ſcruple to tell an untruth (if he
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:204181:177"/>were a man of that ſtamp) which would bring ſuch a great advantage to him as the preſervation of his life.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. He might at leaſt (eſpecially if he had dealt with <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> calumniated him) have put ſome trick or other upon them, and ſhifted himſelf out of the hands of his enemies; for that would have got him more credit and fame than dying for a lye. Why did he not eſcape from them, if he had not both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved this, that he was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and thought it neceſſary alſo to atteſt it, even with his BLOUD? Had he not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to run away? or rather might he not have kept himſelf among his friends, far enough out of their reach? Was it not a queſtion whether he would come to the feaſt or not? xi. <hi>John</hi> 56. Nay, after <hi>the aſſembly of the wicked had incloſed him,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, had he not power to break through them, and make his eſcape? Yes ſure; for what elſe is the meaning of that which you read, xviii. <hi>John</hi> 6. that the <hi>band</hi> of men which came to apprehend him, <hi>went backward, and fell to the ground;</hi> when he did but tell them that He was the man whom they ſought for? Was not this a fit time to flye and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:204181:177"/>get away, when they had no ſtrength to lay hold on him? Had not he power as well to depart, as to weaken their hands that they could not approach him? Nay, was it not far eaſier to go away himſelf, than to make them lie proſtrate there? No doubt of it: only he would ſtand to it, as I ſaid, and make it good by his Bloud that he was the Son of God. He ſhowed that he had not loſt his power to baffle them, but his will was not to uſe it. His death was a voluntary Sacrifice; <hi>He laid down his life</hi> of his own accord, and <hi>no man took it from him,</hi> as it is x. <hi>John</hi> 18. All their Armies, had they <hi>compaſſed him about</hi> (to ſpeak in the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> phraſe) <hi>as strong Bulls of Baſhan;</hi> had they <hi>gaped upon him with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring Lion, i. e.</hi> with the moſt greedy deſire to devour him, could not have touched him, unleſs he had been pleaſed to deliver himſelf up to their fury, and choſen to become their prey, that they might do execution upon him. And therefore it is moſt abſurd, and contrary to nature, to imagine, that He would have thus freely expoſed himſelf to ſuch cruelties and vile uſage as he ſaw was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for him; unleſs he had certainly thought it a moſt eligible and honourable
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:204181:178"/>thing to endure them, in defence of a great Truth, which it concerned all the world to have well aſſerted, and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all ſuſpicion of falſhood.</p>
                     <p>Would it not have angred any man but Him, to be betrayed by a domeſtick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, by a Friend; one whom he had freely choſen to be a great Miniſter in his Kingdom, and had made at preſent the keeper of his purſe, beſides many other favours conferred on him? Was it not a vile diſhonour, firſt to be brought before the Magiſtrate as a Criminal, and then to be abuſed there by baſe ſouldiers, and the dregs of the people; as if there had not been a more contemptible wretch in the whole Country? What was it then to be beaten and cudgelled? to be ſpit upon and mocked? to be loaden with lyes and forgeries? to be condemned to ſuffer among thieves? to be counted leſs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to live than a murderer? to be ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? to be crowned with thorns? to be crucified? that is, to endure a tedious, a diſgraceful, a painful and accurſed death; and after all this to be unpitied; to be laught at even upon the Croſs, and called a ſenſeleſs deceiver, who had not the wit to keep ſome of his kindneſs for himſelf;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:204181:178"/>but having ſaved the lives of others could not now at laſt ſave his own? Can you think of any one that would have the heart to offer himſelf freely to ſuffer ſuch things, but only He, who took all this ſo patiently, that he did not utter one diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented or angry word? And who can think that he would have endured them, when he might have eaſily avoided it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had thought it neceſſary and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſubmit himſelf to ſuch torments and reproaches, that he might confirm this Truth, and make it live by his bloudy death?</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. Which had the greater efficacy in it to ſhow the importance of this Truth, and the certainty which he had of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he affirmed it not only before the High Prieſt, when it was apparent they intended miſchief againſt him, but before <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> alſo, as I obſerved above from xviii. <hi>John</hi> 37. when they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately deſiring him to condemn him. If we could imagine it was his raſhneſs and heat that made him ſay as he did, before the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet he had time enough ſure to have cooled himſelf, before he came to be tried at this other tribunal of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Why did he not think of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:204181:179"/>ſome other anſwer, now that he ſaw the <hi>Jews</hi> were not in a ſudden paſſion, and tranſported with a fit of rage to condemn him; but by a concocted hatred were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to purſue him till they had his bloud? There can no account be given of it but this, That his Death was an advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing, and his BLOUD deliberately ſhed, to obtain the greater belief to him; becauſe he profeſſed again and again (though he knew he muſt die for it) that He was <hi>CHRIST their KING.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. And obſerve likewiſe, that even when he was in the midſt of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and when he was ready to give up the ghoſt, He again ſets his ſeal to this Truth; calling God his FATHER twice as he hung upon the Croſs. Firſt when he prayed for his Enemies, <hi>FATHER for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them,</hi> xxiii. <hi>Luke</hi> 36. and then when he prayed for himſelf, <hi>FATHER into thy hands I commend my Spirit, ver.</hi> 46. With theſe words he reſigned up his Soul to God. And had it not been a ſeaſonable time now to retract what he had ſaid, if it had not been a Truth which muſt be juſtified to the laſt gaſp? How can any one think that a man who preached the Life and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, and lived as if he believed
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:204181:179"/>it, would venture to die with a lye in his mouth? and that of ſo high a guilt? and which he knew alſo could not be long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detected here, as it would be ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht in another place? nay, which He himſelf, he knew very well, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently confute? For he frequently had ſaid, as his very enemies underſtood, that he would riſe again the third day after he was killed; which he muſt needs think would prove a lye, if the other had been ſo, when he told them he was the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God who only can raiſe the dead, but cannot lye, would never have juſtified ſo blaſphemous a lye as this; and given it an undeniable authority, by fulfilling his word. For as his bloudy death plainly proved that he believed himſelf to be the Son of God, and took it for an undoubted truth; ſo his Reſurrection was an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible proof that he was not miſtaken, but had witneſſed that by his death, which was as true as he thought it. His Death ſhow'd that he was certain of it; and his Reſurrection makes us certain that he was not deceived. Theſe two there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be joyned together to make up a complete evidence: and ſo they are, as
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:204181:180"/>you ſhall ſee, for the Witneſs of the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT contains the Reſurrection in it. Yet I muſt add that his BLOUD conſidered alone, did not barely prove that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he was Gods Son, and thought it the greateſt ſin to deny it; but it proved alſo that he had great reaſon for ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; Reaſons ſo weighty that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balanced the natural love of life. And therefore this alone may be called one of his <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> which not only juſtified his integrity, but declared that he had the greateſt aſſurance, and the cleareſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of that which he aſſerted: being ſo certain of it, that the fear of death could not make him doubt it, nor all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the world tempt him to deny it.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. And if you conſider what manner of perſon <hi>Jeſus</hi> was, you will ſoon be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied alſo, that he was not liable to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake ſtrong fancies for weighty reaſons: but was as far from being deceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as he was from any intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others. The principal thing indeed which his <hi>Bloud</hi> teſtified was, that he did not on ſet purpoſe go about to put a cheat upon the World, or invented his Doctrine himſelf. Yet, all things conſidered, it
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:204181:180"/>proves likewiſe that his Doctrine was true, and ought to be believed by us. For ſuch was the quality of his perſon and of the reſt of his Doctrine, that they plainly manifeſt He was neither led by fancy, nor poſſeſſed with any Demoniacal illuſion, when he ſaid he was <hi>the Son of God.</hi> So great was his wiſdom and the ſharpneſs of his underſtanding, that any man who hath not loſt his own underſtanding, may eaſily ſee, he could not be apt to be gull'd with the impoſtures of imagination. And ſo great and diſcreet was his Piety, that it is as viſible he was not obnoxious to be deluded any other way. When He was but a child, He amazed the principal men of the Nation with his queſtions and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. And afterward in the whole courſe of his preaching, there appeared nothing but what declared a moſt prudent, ſober and excellently compoſed mind. Nothing of inequality and unevenneſs in his temper. No rapturous diſcourſes or ecſtatical expreſſions. Nothing that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of Melancholy, which impoſes upon ſome; or of Pride and Vanity which abuſes others. But the greateſt gravity and ſeriouſneſs, mixt with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſweetneſs and humility, is the plain character of our Saviour. Then look over
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:204181:181"/>all his Doctrine, and where ſhall we find any that ever ſpoke ſo clearly, and with ſo much Majeſty, of Righteouſneſs, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Charity and Piety; of all our duty towards God and Man, as he did? Who had the gift of comprehending much in a few, but perſpicuous words; of illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Doctrine with apt and familiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances; of confirming it with power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful arguments, and of confuting all the cavils of his adverſaries with the ſtrongeſt reaſons. None of which things are to be found in any of thoſe who have been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their own fancies and paſſions, or by the juglings of evil Spirits: as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more plainly by conſidering a little more particularly thoſe two cavils.</p>
                     <p>Let it be taken then for granted, that there have been ſome men who meant not to deceive, that were notwithſtanding ſo overborn by a ſtrong fancy or haughty imagination, as not only to take their own dreams for Divine Revelations, but alſo moſt vehemently to aſſert them, even with the loſs of their liberties, eſtate, nay, and life it ſelf. And ſuppoſe withall that there have been ſome, who were ſo fully poſſeſſed with a conceit of nearer commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of God, that they took themſelves to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:204181:181"/>be Chriſt himſelf, or Apoſtles ſent by him; and that no torments could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to think otherways. Yet ſee what a vaſt difference there is between ſuch vain pretenders and our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; even in the very words that they ſpake. And firſt I think it is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that you never read of any man ſo preſumptuous, as to fancy he was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Son of God, who ſits at his right hand, and rules over all, and hath power to judge the quick and the dead. No, theſe vain Enthuſiaſts have only conceited, that they were, after I know not what ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner, made one with Chriſt, and ſo united to God; that, as they phraſe it in ſwoln words of vanity, they were Godded with God, and Chriſted with Chriſt. But who diſcerns not the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity between this fooliſh language and the words of ſoberneſs which our Saviour ſpake? Which indeed is the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing. If you conſider all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of theſe empty Pretenders, there is nothing more ridiculous. They have ever affected big words, lofty and high-flown phraſes, and myſtical expreſſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they love to ſtuff their Books and their diſcourſes: which either have no meaning; or if they have, it is very poor
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:204181:182"/>and deſpicable, when it comes to be ſtript of the fantaſtical language wherewith it is cloathed. And therefore ſuch men have been ſo far from amazing any conſiderate perſons, that they have rather moved their laughter and ſcorn, while they heard them babble nothing but myſtical nonſence, with abundance of confident boldneſs.</p>
                     <p>And if they have found any followers, they were ſuch as had no depth, no ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of judgment; but were carried away merely with the ſound of ſeemingly my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical words; which they could never make any ſober perſon underſtand the ſence of. Whereas, on the contrary, the words of our Saviour are not only intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, but penetrate into the very heart and ſoul of him that reads them. Every man bears witneſs to moſt of them in his own Conſcience: And the reſt are ſuch as plainly aim at the ſame end, to oblige and encourage us to be more ſtrictly pious. And therefore He aſtoniſhed all his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; who acknowledged an Authority in his words, greater than was in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of the wiſeſt men among them. They ſaid, never man ſpake like him. Whole Synagogues, as I have ſhown, wondred at the gracious words, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:204181:182"/>out of his mouth. They enquired one of another, how a man ſhould come by all that wiſdom, who had no learned education. His adverſaries were often ſilenced by his anſwers. They found themſelves ſo non-pluſt, that they durſt not ask him any more queſtions, merely for fear of being more confounded. All which, and much more that might be ſaid, is a ſufficient evidence that he knew very well what He ſaid, and underſtood his doctrine, and was a perſon of a clear reaſon; who could not be abuſed by the impoſtures of fancy and imagination.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. And as for the other cavil, that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly a man may ſuffer the illuſion of evil Spirits, which may make him confident without reaſon: Let it be alſo granted, becauſe the Devil hath ſometimes <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> as the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks; and ſo might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men that God or an Angel had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them, or that they had viſions and revelations from above; with which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit He might ſo poſſeſs them, that they might be ready to take it upon their death, that they ſaid nothing but the Truth. But withall it is notoriouſly evident that ſuch a perſon as our Saviour could not be
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:204181:183"/>liable to ſuch diabolical impreſſions. For <hi>firſt,</hi> the holineſs of his doctrine, which overthrows the Devils kingdom and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, plainly ſhows how much he was in the favour of God. And ſecondly, his conqueſts over the Devil when he aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with his temptations, his turning him out of his poſſeſſion every where, and making him acknowledge his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is an evident token how much ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour he was to him, and ſo not obnoxious to his abuſes. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> they who had been the followers of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but a little while, were too ſtrong for the Devil, and much above his power to hurt them: and therefore how could he himſelf be touched by him. They are S. <hi>John</hi>'s words in this Epiſtle, ii. 14. <hi>I have written unto you, young men, becauſe ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.</hi> And again, the further his doctrine was propagated, the more was the kingdom of the Devil over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and all his cheats detected and diſcovered. As all impiety was plucked up by the roots, and godlineſs planted in the room of it: ſo all ſuperſtitious devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all Magick, all Divination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had long gull'd and couzened the World and kept them in Idolatry, were
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:204181:183"/>laid ſo naked and bare, that they were aſhamed, and preſently vaniſhed. There is an excellent diſcourſe concerning this in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Book, concerning <hi>the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Word;</hi> which muſt not here be entirely tranſcribed, but only theſe few words of it. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; <q>Who then, let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and how great is this CHRIST? who by his name and preſence obſcures and aboliſhes all things every where; and alone prevails over all, and fills the whole world with his Diſcipline? Let the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that bluſh not to deride and laugh at us, tell me, whether He be a mere man who does theſe things. If he be, why do they not bluſh to ſee one man ſtronger than all their Gods? How comes he to demonſtrate by his power, that they are nothing? But if they will call him a Magician, let them tell me again how it comes to paſs that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys all Magick, and doth not rather eſtabliſh it?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that can fancy all that I have now mentioned to have been done by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, which was ſo much to his prejudice; muſt, one would think, be poſſeſſed with ſome evil Spirit himſelf. There is nothing
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:204181:184"/>can declare a man not to be deceived by the Devil, if this will not; that He is the very perſon who lays open all the Devils frauds, and diſcovers his wiles, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers men from all his ſubtil impoſtures. So did our Saviour; and therefore we may conclude that as he believed his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine even concerning himſelf, to be true, ſo that was true which he believed: and that he was not deluded, either by his own private Spirit, or by any elſe. And the truth is, his Adverſaries never took him for a vain Enthuſiaſt, or for a man that was ignorantly deceived; but ſtill they accuſe him as a ſubtil Impoſtor, and would fain have had it thought, that he craftily invented what he preached, to deſtroy their credit, and eſtabliſh his own. But this I have ſhown is incredible: For who could imagine that he ſhould gain any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and reputation by being put to death upon a ſhameful croſs; into which he was not enſnared by their cunning, but foreſaw and frequently foretold, and voluntarily offered himſelf to ſuffer it? Allow him but to be a man of common ſenſe, and you muſt think he would not have contrived this way to procure fame, and to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his doctrine in the world: unleſs he had verily thought it to be ſo true, that
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:204181:184"/>his Croſs, which proved the laughter of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the ſtumbling-block of the <hi>Jews,</hi> could not hinder him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honoured in the World as the Son of God. Nothing elſe could make him chuſe to die on this manner, but his ſincere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of what he preached: and there being no cauſe in the world to ſuſpect any thing of a melancholy proud imagination, or a diabolical illuſion that ſhould impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him ſuch a belief; it remains that our Saviour by his very death proved and confirmed the truth of what he preached. He firſt came by WATER and then he came by BLOUD. And as his BLOUD proves he did not abuſe us, with that which he knew to be falſe; ſo the WA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, his holy Doctrine and Life proves that he had no flaw in his underſtanding, nor was abuſed himſelf with any fancies or illuſions, when he took himſelf to be ſo certainly the Son of God, that he ſealed it with his precious BLOUD.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. And it ought to be conſidered alſo, that it was propheſied before by the holy men of God, that their CHRIST ſhould ſuffer, and be deſpiſed of men, and be in nothing more remarkable than in his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. And therefore his BLOUD was
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:204181:185"/>a ſign to thoſe who believed thoſe prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the CHRIST, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his bloud ſo diſgracefully ſhed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He appeared hereby, as well as by other marks, to be the perſon, whom all their inſpired men pointed at and foretold ſhould come to be their King. For the deſcriptions they have left of the cruel uſage and horrible ſufferings of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> or Chriſt, were anſwered to the life, and exactly fulfilled in our Saviour <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whoſe <hi>torments</hi> rather exceeded than fell ſhort of the tragicalneſs of all their expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thence it is that when He had end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his ſufferings, he ſaid, xix. <hi>John</hi> 30. IT IS FINISHED: and ſo <hi>bowed his head</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> did reverence to God) <hi>and gave up the ghoſt, i.e.</hi> reſigned his Spirit to God in that prayer which S. <hi>Luke</hi> mentions. By which words [<hi>It is finiſhed</hi>] He bad them mark that now all things that were written of him in the xxii. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> liii. <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> and other places of their holy Books, were perfectly fulfilled, and received ſuch a punctual completion in him, that there remained nothing more to be done, but only to die. He had done all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, and finiſhed his whole work in every point, and ſo, having no further buſineſs here, He worſhipped God that
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:204181:185"/>ſent him, and departed the world to go to him.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. It will alſo much advantage this diſcourſe to obſerve the accidents that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at our Saviour's death, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his bloud-ſhedding; which have no ſmall force to verifie what he ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf. And to omit the death of <hi>Judas</hi> which prevented our Lord's, and declared that he thought <hi>Jeſus</hi> innocent, and himſelf guilty; together with ſeveral other things which may be better menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned afterward; let us only obſerve how the Sun contrary to its uſual courſe, when the Moon could not interpoſe it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween its light and them, was eclipſed three whole hours, as he was in his paſſion, xxiii. <hi>Luke</hi> 44, 45. And that in the concluſion of it, <hi>the veil of the Temple</hi> (of that Temple wherein the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo much confided) <hi>was rent in twain from the top to the bottom,</hi> xxvii. Matth. 51. <hi>The Earth quaked, the Rocks rent, and the Graves were opened, and many bodies of Saints which ſlept aroſe, and went out of the Graves after his Reſurrection, and appeared unto many in the holy City, ver.</hi> 52, 53. What judgment can any ſober man make of ſo many ſtrange things concurring at
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:204181:186"/>this moment? When was it ever heard that the Sun bluſht, as one may ſay, to ſhow its face, and look upon him; when any malefactor or innocent man either was hang'd upon a gibbet? or that the holy place was torn, together with that man's body? or that the Earth groaned when he expired? and the hearts of Rocks trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when he cried out, and the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the dead opened at his death, which three days after gave them life? All theſe things were peculiar to the death of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and never met together but only to honour his bloud. And ſo notorious they were, that the <hi>Centurion</hi> and thoſe who under him had the charge at that time to ſee the execution done, were convinced by them and by the words that he ſpake, that he was no Deceiver, but in truth the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>So S. <hi>Matthew</hi> there relates, <hi>ver.</hi> 54. that <hi>when the Centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jeſus, ſaw the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and thoſe things that were done, they feared greatly, ſaying, Truly this man was the Son of God.</hi> Whatſoever the <hi>Jews</hi> had decreed, they ſaw by the diſpleaſure of the Heavens, by the trembling of the Earth, by the hand of God upon the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:204181:186"/>Temple (which was ſoon known by the Prieſts) that <hi>Jeſus</hi> had exceeding great wrong done him; having ſpoken nothing but the truth, when he confeſſed to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> that he was the Son of God. They dreaded to think what would be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of this horrid murder; and were ſorely afraid that they themſelves, who had attended upon it, ſhould feel ſome of thoſe tokens of Gods wrath, which elſewhere was very viſible. But S. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us that the <hi>Centurion</hi> alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the words of our Saviour, as well as was ſtruck with theſe miraculous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and that they helped to convince him, xv. 39. <hi>And when the Centurion which stood over againſt him, ſaw that he ſo cried out, and gave up the ghoſt, he ſaid, Truly this man was the Son of God.</hi> That is, when he heard him call God FATHER (for thoſe were the words, as you heard out of S. <hi>Luke</hi> xxiii. 46. which he cried with a loud voice at the giving up of the ghoſt, <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my Spirit</hi>) and when he ſaw that he ſtood in this to the very laſt breath that God was his <hi>Father,</hi> and alſo beheld ſuch ſtrange teſtimonies of it, both in the Heaven and in the Earth, he ſaid without all doubt he ought to have been acknowledged to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:204181:187"/>be no leſs than he ſaid, and not crucified as a malefactor. And S. <hi>Luke</hi> relates it thus, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> crying with a loud voice, and ſaying thoſe words before mentioned, <hi>The Centurion ſaw what was done</hi> (that is, all ſpoken of in the precedent verſes, xxiii. <hi>Luke</hi> 44, 45, 46.) <hi>and GLORIFIED God ſaying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</hi> 
                        <q>Which was as if he had ſaid, God be praiſed for ſhowing us the truth, or let us do God honour in acknowledging the truth, whatever come of it; I make no queſtion but this man was innocent, and ſaid true when he affirmed he was God's Son; though the <hi>Jews</hi> have got him crucified for this ſaying, and brought us to wait upon his execution.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>That, as I have often noted, was their quarrel with him, <hi>That he being a man made himſelf equal with God,</hi> x. <hi>John</hi> 33. v. 18. This was the blaſphemy they accuſed him of, that he ſaid, <hi>They ſhould ſee the SON OF MAN</hi> (that is, Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) <hi>ſitting at the right hand of power.</hi> But the <hi>Centurion,</hi> an honeſt <hi>Gentile,</hi> acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him of this crime; and ſeeing the things that were done, and hearing the words he uttered, concluded him to be <hi>Righteous,</hi> free from all blame, and not at
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:204181:187"/>all guilty of that blaſphemy for which he was arraigned and ſuffered: but ought to have been believed and acknowledged as the CHRIST, the Son of the bleſſed. Thus was that fulfilled which our Saviour had foretold, viii. <hi>John</hi> 28. <hi>When ye have lift up the Son of Man</hi> (upon the Croſs) <hi>then ſhall ye know that I am He,</hi> (that is, <hi>the CHRIST) and that I do nothing of my ſelf,</hi> (aſſume not this authority of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus without Gods leave) <hi>but as my Father hath taught me, I ſpeak theſe things;</hi> that is, even this that I am his CHRIST is that which he bid me affirm. <hi>And he that ſent me is with me</hi> (to juſtifie what I ſay and do) <hi>the Father hath not left me alone:</hi> (no not upon the Croſs, nor after death, as appears even by this Teſtimony which he forced the <hi>Centurion</hi> to give him) <hi>For I do always thoſe things that pleaſe him.</hi> Keep to my office, that is, both now, and when I ſuffer you to <hi>lift me up</hi> to the Croſs; for God declared that he was never better <hi>pleaſed</hi> with him, than when he laid down his life in this manner, to teſtifie to the truth.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. Which was very much juſtified likewiſe by all that paſſed before this, from the time that the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> had judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:204181:188"/>him worthy of death. In the whole proceſs againſt him, before his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Croſs, there were the plaineſt marks of his innocence: and it may juſtly be reputed a notable teſtimony to him, that their very charge againſt him, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and that he who gave judgment upon him, declared all along he did not deſerve it. Which will make it worthy our conſideration, I think, if I give you as brief a relation as I can of all thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which were preparatory to his Blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy death, after the Chief Prieſts had <hi>bound him and led him away and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the Governour of Judea.</hi> Who, as ſoon as he had examined him whether he was <hi>the King of the Jews,</hi> and received our Saviours anſwer, that he was, xxvii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. preſently diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it was no Earthly Kingdom (as the <hi>Jews</hi> would have had him believe) to which he pretended, and that he did not at all intend to intrench upon the <hi>Roman</hi> rights: as you may ſee evidently if you mind what follows this in S. <hi>Luke</hi> xxiii. 4. <hi>Then ſaid Pilate to the Chief Priests, and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</hi> This netled them very much to hear <hi>him</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced innocent, whom they had judged guilty of the higheſt crime, and therefore
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:204181:188"/>they began with more than ordinary fierceneſs to endeavour to make good their charge; and ſaid <hi>he stirred up the people</hi> (to ſedition, which was an argument, had it been true, that he affected a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in this world which would have been prejudicial to <hi>Caeſar) teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, ver.</hi> 5. But <hi>Pilate</hi> ſo little believed that his Doctrine tended to the raiſing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that, to be rid of any further trouble, he lays hold on that word <hi>Galilee,</hi> where they told him he began to preach, and ſent him to <hi>Herod</hi> the Tetrarch of that Country, who was at that time at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, ver.</hi> 6, 7. But he was ſoon weary of the buſineſs, and remitted him back to <hi>Pilate, arrayed in a gorgeous robe, ver.</hi> 10, 11. as much as to ſay that he could deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine nothing, but that he was a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Monarch, a mock-King, nothing elſe.</p>
                     <p>Being returned to <hi>Pilate,</hi> He received from him many teſtimonies of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence (notwithſtanding that he affirmed he was a KING) and <hi>Pilate</hi> deviſed by ſundry means to deliver him, becauſe as he told them, neither He nor <hi>Herod</hi> could find any fault in him, which ſhould make
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:204181:189"/>him worthy of death, xxiii. <hi>Luke</hi> 13, 14, 15. <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, he gives them their choice (but plainly ſhowed that his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations were to diſmiſs <hi>Jeſus</hi>) whether he ſhould releaſe him, or a notorious villain, who had committed murder in an inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18, &amp;c. And when they moſt ungratefully preferred that ſeditious murderer before him who had given life to ſo many among them, <hi>Pilate</hi> was diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtill to favour him, by reaſon of an admonition he received from his wife (at this very inſtant, when he was ſet down again in the Judgment-ſeat) to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in the condemnation of ſo righteous a perſon; for ſhe had <hi>ſuffered ſo many things,</hi> and been diſturbed with ſuch troubleſome thoughts in her ſleep about him, that ſhe was confident he would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much if he were guilty of his death, xxvii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. This ſtartled him ſo much, that he laboured more than before to ſet him at liberty. He asked <hi>them</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which was unbecoming a Judge, <hi>what he ſhould do with Jeſus which is called CHRIST</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 22.) as if his accuſers, not He, were to determine his puniſhment: But yet he askt them again and again, no leſs than three times, <hi>Why, what evil hath he done?</hi> for he proteſted he found no
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:204181:189"/>cauſe of death in him, xxvii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. xxiii. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. In which laſt place, you may read, that having declared his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, he next of all contrived how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe their blind rage, only by giving him the chaſtiſement of ſcourging. Which S. <hi>John</hi> tells us was beſtowed on him, xix. <hi>John</hi> 1. and that the ſouldiers alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome ridiculous enſigns of royalty, which they put upon him to expoſe him to the greater ſcorn, and made a mock-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, ſaying, <hi>Hail King of the Jews, ver.</hi> 2, 3. This <hi>Pilate</hi> imagined would have given ſatisfaction to their wrath; and <hi>therefore went forth again (ver.</hi> 4.) to let them <hi>know that he found no fault in him.</hi> But they might ſee that he had rendred him ſo contemptible, that no body here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after would follow him as their King. For he brought him forth in that ridiculous dreſs into which the ſouldiers had put him (<hi>ver.</hi> 5.) and bid them look upon him, whether he was not deſpicable enough. That ſeems to be the meaning of thoſe words that follow, <hi>Behold the man.</hi> See what a poor deſpicable perſon they have made him. You need not fear that ſuch a man will do you any harm; for there is nothing of royal Majeſty in him, more than this which you laugh at.</p>

                        <pb n="354" facs="tcp:204181:190"/>But they would not be content with this contempt which was put upon him; their malice was implacable, and nothing would ſuffice them but to have him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Which at the inſtigation of the Prieſts, was demanded by the rabble, who bawled as loud as ever they could, <hi>ſaying, Crucifie him, crucifie him, ver.</hi> 6. As much as to ſay, Go on ſir, thou haſt begun well, proceed to finiſh the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For <hi>ſcourging</hi> uſed to go before <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion,</hi> as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> obſerves upon xxvii. of S. <hi>Matthew. It was appointed by the Roman Laws, that they who were crucified ſhould firſt be ſcourged.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who were taken in the ſiege of <hi>Jern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> by <hi>Titus</hi> (five hundred commonly every day, ſometimes more) were firſt miſerably laſht, and as it were, crucified before-hand with great torments, and then faſtned to a croſs over againſt the wall of the City, as <hi>Joſephus</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> relates in his Book of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> war. By a juſt judgment of God they themſelves ſuffered that from the <hi>Romans,</hi> which they had made our Saviour ſuffer unjuſtly by the ſame hands. For they never left their yelling againſt him, and beſeeching the Governour not to leave off thus; till <hi>Pilate</hi>
                        <pb n="355" facs="tcp:204181:190"/>bid them do the reſt themſelves if they would, for he had rather it ſhould be their act than his: <hi>Take ye him, faith he, and crucifie him; for I find no fault in him, ver.</hi> 6. One would think that the very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this ſpeech was a ſufficient declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Governours mind; beſide that he again repeats it, that he ſaw no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for the putting him to death. But yet they continue to preſs him with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate violence to gratifie their deſires. And ſince they ſaw there was no good to be done, as we ſay, in this way wherein they had hitherto proſecuted him; they form a new endictment againſt him: and tell <hi>Pilate (ver.</hi> 7.) that if he could not find him guilty of death, according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, yet <hi>by their Law he ought to die, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was to make a new Proceſs againſt him, and to forſake the former endict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which accuſed him of Treaſon againſt <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Now they make him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Treaſon againſt Almighty God, and ſeem to lay hold of a Licence which <hi>Pilate</hi> had given them before, xviii. <hi>John</hi> 31. to <hi>take him and judge him according to their Law,</hi> which pronounced the ſentence of
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:204181:191"/>death upon him. But, as they add there, they had no power remaining among them to execute ſuch a ſentence: and therefore implore his favour to help them out, and to <hi>puniſh</hi> capitally this high crime of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, which, as things ſtood, they could only <hi>condemn.</hi> And though they might be willing enough to underſtand his words juſt now ſpoken (when he ſaid, <hi>Take ye him, and crucifie him</hi>) to be really meant for an enlargement of his former grant, and to give them liberty to execute their own ſentence: yet it was more than they could do, they muſt be beholden to his power for it. They were extremely deſirous, it appears by the ſtory, to have him crucified, for his greater diſgrace; but this was a puniſhment proper only to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and never uſed among the <hi>Jews:</hi> and therefore that they might nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act againſt the cuſtoms of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, nor yet let him eſcape that ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous puniſhment, they continue to beg of <hi>Pilate</hi> that he would pronounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of crucifixion upon him, and then command his ſouldiers to ſee it executed; for ſaying that he was <hi>the Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Pilate</hi> therefore heard this (xix. <hi>John</hi> 8.) that he called himſelf the <hi>Son of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:204181:191"/>God</hi> (which the <hi>Jews</hi> took for blaſphemy) it put him into a greater fear than ever. He imagining, I ſuppoſe, according to the opinion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that he might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be ſome Son of <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or ſome other of their Deities. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went back again into the Palace (<hi>ver.</hi> 9.) and askt our Saviour, <hi>Whence art thou?</hi> To which our Saviour replied nothing: either becauſe he was unworthy to hear, or uncapable to underſtand ſo weighty a Truth. This put him into ſome indignation, for he asked him again with arrogance enough (<hi>ver.</hi> 10.) <hi>Doſt thou not ſpeak to me? knoweſt thou not who I am? and that I have power either to crucifie thee, or releaſe thee,</hi> which I pleaſe? To which he received ſuch an anſwer (<hi>ver.</hi> 11.) as ſatisfied him, that whatſoever power he had, he ſhould abuſe it, though not ſo much as the <hi>Jews</hi> did theirs, if he imployed it to his condemnation. For <hi>from thenceforth</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 12.) he laboured more than before to releaſe <hi>him,</hi> whoſe innocence, modeſty, conſtancy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of death were ſo apparent. But being told that if he did, it would be in effect to declare himſelf <hi>Caeſars</hi> enemy, as you read in the ſame verſe; He had not the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to befriend our Saviour any longer,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:204181:192"/>but reſolves at laſt to ſacrifice him to their rage, that he might ſave himſelf. For the very ſuſpicion of a crime, he knew, had been the ruine of divers perſons with <hi>Tiberius;</hi> who would not want informers, he imagined, of what was now ſaid. He thought it better therefore by the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of an innocent perſon (ſuch are the counſels of worldly wiſdom) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his intereſt in the Emperor, and in the <hi>Jews,</hi> and perchance prevent a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tumult, than hazard the loſs of their favour and of the publick peace, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving one who was poor and mean, and for whoſe death he was not like to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to any account, nor incur any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>But yet (ſo pure and free from all ſpot was this Lamb of God) he would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ſentence againſt him, till he had firſt, in as publick a manner, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him innocent, and waſhed his hands of his bloud. For <hi>he took water,</hi> ſays S. <hi>Matthew</hi> xxvii. 24. <hi>and waſhed his hands before the multitude, ſaying, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of the bloud of this juſt perſon; ſee ye to it.</hi> This very WATER, as well as the other, I have mentioned, was a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that his very Judge thought
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:204181:192"/>him guiltleſs, though he had openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf to be the Son of God. If it had been left to his free choice, he ſhould have been acquitted, even by him that condemned him: He had ſuch a regret in his mind, at that very time when he brought him forth to paſs the ſentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he tries again if he could move thoſe obdurate hearts from their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el reſolution; ſaying, (xix. <hi>John</hi> 13, 14.) <hi>Behold your King.</hi> That is, ſay what you will, this is your King, whom I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe you will not elſe be ſatisfied, to condemn. Or elſe, this is ſpoken by way of upbraiding and deriſion, that they ſhould make ſuch a do about ſo poor a man as this; who had no power to do any harm if he had a mind. Why ſhould they deſire ſo eagerly and impatiently to be rid of him? If he was their King, how could they anſwer it? if he were not, what hurt could he do? But the former ſeems to be the ſence of his words: for the <hi>Jews</hi> turned away their heads, and <hi>cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucifie him, ver.</hi> 15. As much as to ſay, This is none of our King, we have nothing to do with him: And therefore they would not have him trouble himſelf about their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs any further, than only to order him
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:204181:193"/>to be crucified. Let him not be ſo much concerned for them, or for their King; they would look to themſelves (as he had bidden them) and be content to bear all the blame, if their King were crucified. They did not deſire any of the guilt ſhould light upon him. No, for their part they declare they will perfectly acquit him, and take all upon themſelves and theirs. So <hi>all the People anſwered and ſaid, His blood be on us, and on our Children:</hi> xxvii. Matth. 25.</p>
                     <p>And yet, as if he would vie with them in pertinacious reſolution (ſo ſenſible he was of his innocence) he deſires them once more, to conſider of the buſineſs, and not thus raſhly deſtroy him whom they ought to preſerve. What, ſays he, <hi>Shall I crucifie your King?</hi> xix. Joh. 15. To which the chief Prieſts immediately returned ſuch an anſwer as ſtopt his mouth, and made him not dare to ſpeak one word more in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. And indeed it is a great wonder he had ſaid ſo much, conſidering his natural diſpoſition; which, if we may believe <hi>Philo</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Legation. ad Caium.</note>, was ſo fierce and cruel, that he little regarded any body; or cared what crimes he committed. Strange! that he ſhould be ſo nice and tender in this point:
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:204181:193"/>So extremely unwilling to paſs ſentence on our Saviour (a Man that had not one friend appeared for him) that nothing could make him do it, till they reminded him of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his Maſter, ſaying, <hi>We have</hi> (i. e. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) <hi>no King but Caeſar. Then,</hi> as it follows in the very next words, verſ. 16. <hi>delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified.</hi> When he heard they ſtill obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately pretended reſpect to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and would have <hi>him</hi> to be concerned in the caſe; he thought it was time to make an end, and give ſentence that their new King ſhould be crucified. For this at laſt was the crime, for which he muſt ſuffer, verſ. 19. <hi>Pilate wrote a title</hi> (ſhowing the cauſe of his death) <hi>and put it on the Croſs. And the Writing was,</hi> JESUS OF NAZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. Which <hi>Pilate</hi> knew was falſe, in the ſence wherein they meant it, a King oppoſite to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> and therefore the words were ſo contrived that he might ſtill expreſs the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion he had of him, and yet ſatisfie <hi>Caeſar</hi> too. To the very laſt he would give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the innocence of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as far as he durſt: and even then proclaimed him their King in ſeveral Languages (an Omen of the proclaiming it ſhortly in all Countries) to their everlaſting reproach; when he
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:204181:194"/>hung upon an infamous Gibbet. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were not yet ſatisfied; becauſe they ſaw themſelves plainly indited by this Title, in the face of the World; as the Murderers of their KING. Which made them renew their Petitions to <hi>Pilate</hi> that he would alter the Inſcription; and not write <hi>The King of the Jews, but that he ſaid, I am King of the Jews,</hi> verſ. 21. But now <hi>Pilate</hi> grew as obſtinate as they, and gave them this ſhort anſwer, verſ. 22. <hi>What I have written, I have written.</hi> That is, content your ſelves; for the firſt writing ſhall ſtand, let the World make what they can of it. And there is no queſtion but there was a Divine Providence in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, that the cauſe of his death ſhould be ſo expreſſed, as that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be openly condemned and <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſtill cleared by <hi>Pilate;</hi> even after he had not only gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſentence againſt him, but ordered it to be put in execution. All things concurred to juſtifie him when his BLOUD was ſhed. Which this very Title declared was upon this account, to teſtifie that he was <hi>their KING:</hi> and told the World withall, that in the judgment of him who was his Judge, He was no deceiver, when he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that he was <hi>their KING;</hi> but the <hi>Jews,</hi> villainous Traytors, who had cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:204181:194"/>that Perſon whom they ought to have honoured and obeyed.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. For which the terrible vengeance of God followed them; and never left them till they had their own wiſh. His BLOUD was required at their hands, and at the hands of their Poſterity. For they never thrive from that time forward: but declined more and more, till about Forty Years after, their City was beſieged by thoſe whom they had importuned to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify our Saviour; multitudes of them were crucified (as I told you before) in the face of all their Brethren; far greater numbers were famiſht; <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple at laſt deſtroyed; the People of the Nation baniſhed; and their Children became Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds, even to this day. For it was not very long, before thoſe very Men, who (when they ſaid thoſe words, <hi>We have no King, but Caeſar</hi>) in the ſame breath had for ever renounced their CHRIST, and pronounced themſelves Rebels, if they were not obedient to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> took up arms to deliver themſelves from their ſubjection to him, whom they really hated, though, now, to ſerve a turn, they courted and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. They who had rejected their <hi>true CHRIST</hi> and KING by whom they might
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:204181:195"/>have been reſtored to true liberty, were ready upon all occaſions to run after thoſe <hi>falſe CHRISTS</hi> (of whom our Saviour propheſied, xxiv. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.24.) who by the promiſes of a falſe liberty, led them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perdition. They could never be quiet till they had undone themſelves, by provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the only King whom they pretended to reverence, to be the Inſtrument of our Saviour, to make them the vileſt ſlaves, and the moſt miſerable wretches upon the face of the Earth. S. <hi>John</hi> lived to ſee the day of Jeſus his COMING WITH POW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER to execute Judgment upon them; and we ſee their wiſh ſtill more and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed upon their Children. Who, as they never yet ſolemnly indeavoured to wipe off the guilt of his BLOUD from them, by acknowledging the crime of their Fore-fathers (as the manner of former times was, we ſee in the examples of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi>) ſo they continue to taſte of the bitter fruits of this execrable Treaſon againſt their Soveraign Lord and King, CHRIST JESUS. By which you may ſee, that his BLOUD both upon the <hi>Croſs</hi> and upon their <hi>Heads</hi> (by the heavy guilt it loaded them withall) is very fitly here alledged by S. <hi>John,</hi> as a great WIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS that He was ſent of God as his <hi>only
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:204181:195"/>Son.</hi> For <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> himſelf did not wholly eſcape, but ſome of it lighted alſo upon his Head. Though he was not ſo guilty, our Saviour confeſſed, as they who purſued him out of hatred, whereas he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no unkindneſs for him, delivered him to be crucified, only out of fear: yet he felt the weight of this crime, and was oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf, as our Saviour had been, by falſe accuſations which the <hi>Samaritaus</hi> brought againſt him. Whereupon he was deprived of the Government of <hi>Judaea</hi> by <hi>Vitellius</hi> then Preſident of <hi>Syria.</hi> And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt the authority, which he abuſed in condemning our Saviour; he was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there anſwer the crimes that ſhould be objected to him. There indeed he found <hi>Tiberius</hi> dead; but he did not live long after him. For he fell into ſo diſtreſſed a condition, that, about the third year of the ſucceeding Emperor <hi>Caius,</hi>

                     <p>
                        <pb n="366" facs="tcp:204181:196"/>But I ſhall not purſue either his or their ſtory any further; it being time to put an end to this Argument, which I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with theſe <hi>Two</hi> obſervations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That after our Saviour was dead, one of the ſouldiers pierced his ſide with his ſpear, <hi>and forthwith came there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out WATER and BLOUD,</hi> as this very Apoſtle hath recorded in the Chapter ſo often mentioned, xix. <hi>John</hi> 34. Now ſome have from hence imagined, that he being the only Evangeliſt that takes any notice of this, and ſetting a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark upon it, as a thing that <hi>he ſaw and bears witneſs of, ver.</hi> 35. it is moſt likely he hath ſome reſpect to that paſſage in his Goſpel, and to the <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> there mentioned, when he ſpeaks of the witneſs of WATER and BLOUD here in this Epiſtle. For the Water and Bloud which flowed out of his ſide, were an argument of the truth of his humanity, which ſome wild Hereticks then denied, and teſtified alſo that he was truly dead, and not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in appearance.</p>
                     <p>But it muſt be obſerved that S. <hi>John</hi> is not here proving <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt to be a true
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:204181:196"/>man, conſiſting of Body and Soul like ours, and that this Body and Soul were ſo ſeparated, that he was really dead: but ſomething far greater and more excellent, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was God's Son: which the <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> that came out of his ſide were no competent argument to prove. That <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> therefore, if they have any relation to theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> here mentioned, were only emblems and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umbrations of theſe two grand Proofs of our Saviours being the CHRIST, <hi>viz.</hi> his PURITY and innocence which appeared in his whole preaching and life, to which the <hi>Water</hi> bears a reſemblance; and his conſtant confeſſion of the truth even unto the DEATH, which was live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented by that <hi>Bloud.</hi> Theſe two flowed from him with ſuch force, that they have overſpread the world with his Faith; and <hi>the knowledge of the glory of the Lord hath covered the Earth, even like to the waters which cover the Sea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecond</hi> Obſervation is, That they who by apoſtaſie from the Faith of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> denied him to be <hi>the CHRIST</hi> after they had acknowledged it, are ſaid to <hi>tread under foot the Son of God,</hi> and to <hi>count his BLOUD an unholy thing,</hi> x. <hi>Heb.</hi> 29.
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:204181:197"/>Which expreſſion could not be juſtified, if the Apoſtles had not lookt upon his <hi>Bloud</hi> as an unreproveable Witneſs to him. For the meaning is, that thoſe men who fell back to their old Religion again, and deſerted Chriſtianity, made nothing of the Teſtimony which God had given of his Son. As for his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> they did not give any credit to that, though ſo ſtrongly atteſted, but <hi>TROD UNDER FOOT the Son of God,</hi> as if he lay ſtill in his grave: and as for his <hi>Bloud</hi> which was ſhed at his <hi>Death,</hi> they look'd upon that as if it were but COMMON BLOUD (ſo the word UNHOLY may be taken) or rather as if it were the <hi>bloud</hi> of a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, which may be properly called <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure</hi> and <hi>unholy.</hi> Which is the reaſon that he ſays they ſhall be judged worthy of <hi>ſorer puniſhment</hi> than the contemners of <hi>Moſes;</hi> becauſe theſe men in effect made <hi>Jeſus</hi> (who was infinitely greater than He) to be a mere Impoſtor, a falſe Prophet, and a Blaſphemer, who had done things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the vileſt death. They juſtified thoſe that murdered him, and <hi>crucified the Son of God afreſh</hi> (as it is in a parallel place, vi. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.) by diſowning him and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was <hi>the CHRIST.</hi> For this was to acknowledge that he was juſtly
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:204181:197"/>put to death, for taking upon him that office: and that if he were upon Earth again, they ſaw no reaſon why they ſhould not treat him, as the <hi>Jews</hi> had done. This was the ſence of every Chriſtians apoſtaſie; it renewed the charge of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture againſt <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>put him,</hi> as the Apoſtle there ſpeaks, <hi>to open ſhame.</hi> They did as bad as publickly declare him to be a deceiver; and that he deſerved to loſe his life in that infamous manner wherein he ſuffered upon the Croſs. For which cauſe ſuch vilifiers of <hi>Jeſus</hi> deſerved to partake in that <hi>judgment and fiery indignation,</hi> which he ſays was ready <hi>to devour the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 27.) that is, thoſe who actually crucified Chriſt, and now perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted his ſervants: for they had his <hi>BLOUD</hi> in the ſame contempt, and made no more of it, than of the bloud of one of the Thieves that were crucified with him.</p>
                     <p>Now from hence it follows that his BLOUD teſtified his innocence (as I have ſhown) and was look'd upon by others as well as by S. <hi>John</hi> to be a witneſs that he was the Son of God. Elſe they could not have been guilty of ſo great a crime, and faln under ſuch an heavy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:204181:198"/>who deſpiſed his <hi>Bloud,</hi> and were no more moved by it than if it had been common, like the bloud of other men; nay, relinquiſhed him, as if his bloud had been profane, like that of the malefactors who ſuffered with him. This was their condemnation, that they caſt ſuch a vile reflection on that bloud, which heretofore they thought ſo powerful, that <hi>thereby they were SANCTIFIED;</hi> that is, perſwaded to devote themſelves to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as the only means to obtain remiſſion of their ſins, which they had by his Bloud. This is a ſign that they look'd upon it once, not only as a thing <hi>moſt ſacred,</hi> but alſo moſt <hi>powerful</hi> to make men believe in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> And this increaſed the ſin and guilt of diſhonouring his Bloud by Apoſtaſie; becauſe it was of great authority and force to draw men to the Faith, and to preſerve them in it: which, by forſaking the Faith it confirmed, they made to be of no effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nor conſideration at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> his Covenant and Law were ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only <hi>by the bloud of Bulls and Goats,</hi> and yet thoſe men ſuffered death without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as the Apoſtle here obſerves, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fell away to other gods, or did any thing preſumptuouſly in contempt of his
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:204181:198"/>precepts. By which we may judge, ſays he, what they are like to ſuffer (a much ſorer puniſhment ſure) who renounce the Chriſtian Religion, which was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a much greater perſon, and by a more noble bloud, even by the bloud of the Mediator of this better Covenant. Who did more than <hi>Moſes</hi> ever thought of to atteſt what he delivered, and to prove that he came from God, and that all his promiſes ſhould be made good (for he ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with his own bloud) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might juſtly expect that men ſhould prove more faithful to him, and remain firmer in his obedience; at leaſt not be ſo preſumptuous as to deſpiſe him by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching his precious Bloud. Now if his <hi>Bloud</hi> was not an argument to induce men to believe, and to continue in the ſtate of Chriſtianity; they could not be charged with ſuch diſreſpect to it, when they left this Religion, nor be puniſhed for the undervaluing or rather ſcorning that which was of no force to tye them to the Faith. But if they were guilty of great contempt of it, and were to ſuffer ſorely, extream ſorely upon this account, that they gave no more reverence to his bloud, then we ought to conclude the Apoſtles thought it of great efficacy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:204181:199"/>their belief, and make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly adhere to Chriſt, by the witneſs that it bare to him. Which teſtimony, together with the reſt, thoſe apoſtates plainly rejecting, they became liable to a far heavier condemnation than any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly could fall into, for affronting <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all thoſe who were his <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> In ſhort, they who did not look upon his bloud as <hi>Holy,</hi> muſt condemn him for a Malefactor. But they that did confeſs the ſacredneſs of it (which appears many ways) muſt needs acknowledge him not to have been a Criminal, as the <hi>Jews</hi> pretended, but, the <hi>Son of God,</hi> as at his death he profeſſed himſelf.</p>

Help us to</hi> ſtand faſt in the Faith, <hi>to</hi> quit our ſelves like men, <hi>and</hi> to be ſtrong, <hi>as becomes thy faithful ſervants and ſouldiers, who have vowed to be true to thee unto our lives end.</hi>

                           <hi>O Bleſſed</hi> Jeſus, <hi>who can think that he does or endures too much for thee? Who can complain of thy ſervice, or repine at the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings it may require? When he thinks of thy labour and pains to ſecure our hope in God of an eternal redemption from all miſeries and troubles, and from all ſin the cauſe of them, by ſhedding thy own moſt holy bloud? We are unworthy to bear the Name of thy ſervants, if we ſhould be ſo ungrateful to thy memory, as not to celebrate that love with perpetual praiſes and thankſgivings. And how fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhall we reproach our ſelves if we continue to commemorate it, and yet grudge to deny any thing for thy ſake, or behave our ſelves as if we would renew thy ſufferings by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſins? Far be it from any of us to think any thing ſo dear to us as Truth and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; that holy Truth which thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to us. O that we may read with ſuch an affection the whole hiſtory of thy love, and all the Laws thou haſt left to govern us, and the gracious grants thou haſt made us; as if we ſaw them written in thy moſt precious bloud: By which thou haſt teſtified the greatneſs and ſincerity of thy love, and aſſured us of the truth of thy Word, and conſecrated thy ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be a merciful and faithful High Prieſt; who canſt have compaſſion on us, and ever

And may we be ſo ſenſibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected herewith, as to depend on thy inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion with the stronger Faith; and with greater care and diligence tread in thoſe steps which thou haſt in ſuch a manner markt out to us; and perſiſt in them ſo stedfaſtly, that none of the terrors of this world may make us step aſide, and turn from thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

That we who believe in a Saviour who abaſed and humbled himſelf ſo low, who was ſo content to be poor and little regarded, to bear all the ſlanders and ſcorn, as well as the cruel torments which the malice of men could inflict upon him; may not be proud and inſolent, covetous and ambitious, impatient of pain, or a little diſparagement: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly endeavouring to conform our ſelves to thy glorious pattern which we have before us,

                     <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Concerning the</hi> Third <hi>Witneſs upon Earth the SPIRIT.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THere is one <hi>Witneſs</hi> more that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſtill to be examined, whoſe teſtimony was notorious and very well known, for it was upon the Earth; <hi>viz.</hi> that of the SPIRIT. In the <hi>ſixth</hi> verſe S. <hi>John</hi> brings it in after the other two, I have now treated of; though in the <hi>eighth</hi> Verſe it be ſet before them. And there he adds this illuſtrious character of it, which is not given to the two former, <hi>it is the SPIRIT that beareth witneſs, becauſe the SPIRIT is the TRUTH.</hi> Which is not to be underſtood as if the other two were not <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> for they are called ſo expreſly in this <hi>eighth</hi> Verſe; or as if they were not <hi>truth,</hi> for I have abundantly proved that they are: But this mark is ſet upon the SPIRIT, to denote it to be the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:204181:203"/>Witneſs of the Three. <hi>The</hi> witneſs, or <hi>that</hi> Witneſs; that which excels the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two in clearneſs and notoriouſneſs; that which was alwayes accounted moſt powerful to prove a truth; that againſt which nothing can be objected but with the greateſt impudence and impiety; that which adds greater ſtrength and force un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other two, and together with them makes up a moſt compleat demonſtration. For whatſoever defect any one may think there is in the witneſs of the <hi>Water</hi> and of the <hi>Bloud</hi> alone; the SPIRIT perfectly ſupplies it, and proves beyond all doubt that a perſon who ſo lived and ſo dyed, muſt needs be the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now by the SPIRIT we are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, either the deſcent of the Spirit of God upon our Saviour at his Baptiſm, or the pouring of it upon the Apoſtles on the Day of Pentecoſt, or any thing of like nature; for this was the Teſtimony of the HOLY GHOST, and that from <hi>Heaven.</hi> But we are to underſtand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>firſt</hi> the <hi>Miracles, Wonders</hi> and <hi>Signs</hi> which were wrought by him before he dyed; and <hi>ſecondly</hi> his more wonderful <hi>Reſurrection</hi> to life again, after he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, dead and buried. I will not be too
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:204181:203"/>confident, but I think there is a plain dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which is not obſerved, between the HOLY GHOST and the SPIRIT, in the phraſe of the New Teſtament. By the HOLY GHOST ſeems commonly to be meant, the gifts of Tongues, of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, of Knowledge, of Wiſdom, of Revelation, and ſuch like. Whereas by the SPIRIT, when it is uſed alone, or in diſtinction from the other, is generally meant, the power of Miracles, of healing Diſeaſes, caſting out Devils, feeding Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes with very little food, and ſuch like wonders. For we read that the <hi>HOLY GHOST was not</hi> given while our Saviour lived, vii. <hi>John</hi> 39. And yet even then the Apoſtles had the power of caſting out Devils, and healing all manner of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; which was a portion of that SPIRIT which our Saviour had <hi>without meaſure,</hi> but was not the HOLY GHOST. Thus <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſays our Lord was anointed with the <hi>HOLY GHOST and with</hi> POWER, x. Act. 38. Where by POWER is meant ſomething diſtinct from the HOLY GHOST; even that which is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led SPIRIT, a faculty of doing wonders; as the other ſignifies a faculty of knowing the heart, of declaring the mind of God, of foretelling things to come, of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:204181:204"/>and opening all the ſecrets of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>And thus I am ſure it ſignifies in the Old Teſtament; where when the <hi>SPIRIT of the Lord</hi> is ſaid to come upon <hi>Othniel,</hi> iii. Judg. 9. upon <hi>Gideon,</hi> vi. 34. upon <hi>Samſon,</hi> xiii. 25. xiv. 6. (as I may have occaſion to note more largely upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion) there is nothing intended of the HOLY GHOST or any gift of declaring God's mind that was then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them: But they were then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made valorous and couragious; and were indued with great ſtrength to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve wonderful things, above the power of Man. And indeed in this conſiſts one principal difference, between the HOLY GHOST and the SPIRIT; that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conſecrated Men to the office of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting God's mind; but the latter did not: making them only valiant (as in thoſe three now mentioned) or fit for the Government of God's People, as in the caſe of <hi>Saul.</hi> All which is ſaid briefly to ſhow what we are here to underſtand by the SPIRIT, <hi>viz.</hi> all the wonderful things that our Lord <hi>did,</hi> and all that were <hi>done</hi> for him upon the Earth. For, whatſoever may be thought of the reſt, there is no
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:204181:204"/>doubt of this, that when the HOLY GHOST and the SPIRIT are thus diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, as they are here by S. <hi>John</hi> (the one being a witneſs in <hi>Heaven,</hi> the other on <hi>Earth</hi>) SPIRIT muſt be taken in this limited and reſtrained ſignification.</p>

                        <p>And firſt, I ſay, <hi>All that he did,</hi> as his cleanſing the poor Lepers; opening the eyes of the blind; curing of the Palſie, Bloudy-flux, and indeed all manner of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſeaſe; commanding the Wind and the Sea to be obedient to him; walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Water; feeding many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands with a few Loaves and Fiſhes; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an hundred times more fragments than there was meat; caſting out of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and raiſing of the Dead; all theſe were notable witneſſes to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the SPIRIT bare record that He was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that he, <hi>being Gods beloved in whom his Soul was well pleaſed,</hi> would appear in this manner; for God, he ſays, would <hi>put his SPIRIT upon him.</hi> This S. <hi>Matthew</hi> takes notice of, and applies to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> x. 18. juſt after he had cured a Man who had his hand withered: which ſhows what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:204181:205"/>by the SPIRIT. And our Lord himſelf alſo expounds the meaning of it in the following Verſes. For after the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of that Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt relates immediately how He healed a Man <hi>poſſeſſed with a Devil blind and dumb,</hi> verſ. 22. which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſpitefully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing to the power of the Devil, and not of God, He confutes them by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that then the Devil would pull down his own Kingdom. What men of ſence, could imagine him to be ſo fooliſh? He was not yet ſo blind as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were: who ought to have concluded from theſe miraculous works, (verſ. 28.) that if he <hi>by the SPIRIT of God east out Devils</hi> (as it could be by nothing elſe, according to the argument now named) then it was apparent <hi>the Kingdom of God was come unto them.</hi> Here he both tells us what the SPIRIT ſignifies, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch a power as this of caſting out Devils; and alſo what was the end of giving the SPIRIT, <hi>viz.</hi> that they might know the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and his <hi>Kingdome</hi> was come. And whom could they take to be their KING, but he who appeared anointed with ſuch a SPIRIT, and who communicated the ſame power unto others?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="385" facs="tcp:204181:205"/>For this was an evident demonſtration, that the voice was no empty ſound which ſaid, <hi>Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> and that it was no deception, when <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt thought he ſaw the SPIRIT deſcend and remain upon him. It was plain by this, that indeed he was very dear to God, and that he had a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power</hi> reſiding and dwelling in him; which proved him to be as great as that voice proclaimed him. That there was a mighty <hi>Power</hi> in him, his ſworn Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could not deny. The very accuſation of Magick, which we find to this day in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Books, againſt him, does us this ſervice; that it is an open acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there were ſuch miraculous things done, as are recorded in the Goſpel ſtory. Which being granted, it is apparent the power that wrought them was <hi>Divine,</hi> and that there was nothing of the Devil in the buſineſs; by our Saviours argument in the place now named. For how could the Devil be ſuppoſed to aſſiſt in ſuch operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, unleſs we will conceive him to have ſo little wit, as to contrive the moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual way to overthrow all his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? The very end for which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour diſpoſſeſſed Devils, and did all other
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:204181:206"/>miraculous cures, was to win honour to God; whereas the Devil, in all that he doth, hath the quite contrary drift. If we ſhould ſuppoſe with the Phariſees that he hath ſometimes ſuffered himſelf to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his Copartners, it hath ever been with the ſame deſign, that cunning Gameſters have; who permit a meer bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to beat them a ſet or two, only to draw them in to play for a greater ſtake. He never gives way to any of his Friends, or ſeems to be afraid of their authority over him, but it is to bring Men to an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his power; or to ſeduce them to the performance of ſome magical ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to him. Whereas our Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded no other reward for all his chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Cures, but this alone; that they whom he had thus obliged, ſhould thank GOD, and give him glory, and ſin no more.</p>
                        <p>To this purpoſe <hi>Origen</hi> admirably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, in the latter end of his firſt Book againſt <hi>Celſus.</hi> 
                           <q>It is ſenceleſs to think that any of his Miracles were done by Magick; for there never was any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician, that called Men to the forſaking of the Devil and all Idolatry, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them to amend their lives in
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:204181:206"/>good earneſt. They never inſtructed them in the fear of God by all their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful tricks; nor taught thoſe that ſaw them <hi>ſo to live, as thoſe that are to be tryed and judged by God.</hi> This is none of their buſineſs. They neither can nor will carry on ſuch a deſign; nor have any thing to do with the amendment of Mankind: being themſelves full of all filthineſs and ſwarming with the moſt abominable Vices. But he who by all the wonderful things he did, called the ſpectators to the correction of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and the amendment of their lives; propounded himſelf alſo, not only to his familiar diſciples, but to all others <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, a pattern and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the beſt and moſt excellent life. That ſo, both his Diſciples might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to teach Men the will of God; and others, being taught by his Word and manners more than by his Miracles how to live, might have reſpect to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in all they did, but how to pleaſe God. Now if the life of Jeſus was ſuch as this, what Man of ſence is there that can compare him with Magicians, and not rather believe him to be God appearing in an humane body, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </p>
                        <p>But, becauſe this Argument is very large, let us draw it into a narrower compaſs; and take particular notice onely of theſe two ſorts of miraculous works; <hi>caſting out of Devils,</hi> and <hi>raiſing the dead.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">I. As for the former, the <hi>caſting of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> out of a number of diſtracted and mad or melancholy People, whoſe depraved imaginations were oft-times furiouſly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the power of evil ſpirits; it is the more remarkable, becauſe it declares he had as great a power over the inviſible World, as they ſaw him have over the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Men, and over the water, the winds, and things growing upon the Earth: all which yield ſome examples of his Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous works. Who could this be, but the Lord of Angels and Men and all other things, who commanded the Prince of the power of the Air and all his Legions, and they could not reſiſt him? Was it not an Argument that <hi>God was with him,</hi> as <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſpeaks, when no created power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever could withſtand him? For you may obſerve further, (2.) That there were no kind of Devils which did not preſently

The Prince of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils might have been ſuppoſed, to have had power over the leſſer fry. But ſince it was apparent, that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, all the fury and madneſs of Daemons fled before him, at the very mention of his Name; we muſt confeſs that <hi>our Lord and Saviour was no Daemonaical power; but the very Son of God, the Word,</hi> (as he ſpeaks) <hi>the Wiſdome and the Power of the Father.</hi> Nay, (3.) he not only expelled them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but gave his Twelve Apoſtles autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to caſt them out. Thereby ſhowing he came to deliver Men from the dominion of the Devil, in that he gave the meaneſt Men ſuch power over him. <hi>Go ye,</hi> ſays he, x. Matth. 7.8. <hi>and preach, ſaying, The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is at hand; heal the ſick, cleanſe the lepers, raiſe the dead, cast out Devils, freely ye have received, freely give.</hi> This was long before they received the <hi>HOLY GHOST,</hi> preſently after they were called into his attendance; and therefore was a portion of the <hi>SPIRIT,</hi> which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified their <hi>CHRIST</hi> or <hi>KING</hi> was
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:204181:208"/>not far off, but would ſhortly viſit them. For they were ſent to prepare the people for him, as <hi>ſeventy two</hi> Diſciples more were afterward, though with a leſs porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the SPIRIT than the twelve Apoſtles had. For when he ſent them with the ſame commiſſion to <hi>preach,</hi> that the other had, we read of no other <hi>power</hi> given them, but <hi>to heal the ſick</hi> in every City, whereinto they came, x. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. But they were poſſeſſed with ſuch an high opinion of the power of their Maſter who ſent them, that they adventured further; and in his name <hi>cast out Devils,</hi> as well as healed ſick people. For when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back to give him an account, they tell him, with no ſmall joy, <hi>Lord, even the Devils are ſubject unto us through thy name, ver.</hi> 17.</p>
                        <p>Which might well have ſuch power, though they had no particular authority given them to caſt out Devils by it, ſince it was very terrible to them (you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve further (4.)) when pronounced by thoſe who were not of our Saviours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. So <hi>S. Mark</hi> relates, ix. 38. that S. <hi>John</hi> brought a report to him of a man whom they had ſeen caſting out Devils in his name, and yet was none of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:204181:208"/>for <hi>we forbad him,</hi> ſays he, <hi>becauſe he followeth not us.</hi> To which <hi>Jeſus</hi> replies, that there was no cauſe to prohibite him; for this muſt needs prove a convincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to the man himſelf, if not to others, that he was <hi>the Chriſt, ver.</hi> 39. <hi>There is no man which ſhall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly ſpeak evil of me.</hi> Of this ſort they ſeem to have been to whom our Saviour appeals when the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> accuſed him of confederacy with <hi>Beelzebub.</hi> That's ſtrange, ſaith He, did you ever hear of a Devil caſt out in the name of any Magician? In my name there is, even by thoſe who are more related to you, than they are to me: Let them therefore determine this matter. That ſeems to be the ſence of thoſe words, xii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. <hi>By whom then do your children cast them out? therefore they ſhall be your Judges.</hi> There are thoſe who are none of my Diſciples, but yours, that uſe my name for the caſting out of Devils, who immediately fly before them. What do you think of <hi>them;</hi> do <hi>they</hi> deal with <hi>Beelzebub?</hi> I know you will not paſs ſuch a judgment on your own diſciples, and therefore this fact of theirs condemns your partiality, and proves my Divine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="392" facs="tcp:204181:209"/>Nay, the Devils themſelves we find, (5.) were ſo aſtoniſhed at this power which they felt in his name, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they acknowledged him to be the CHRIST. For that's their meaning when they confeſſed him to be the <hi>HOLY ONE of God,</hi> i. <hi>Mark</hi> 24. And ſo S. <hi>Luke</hi> expounds it, iv. 41. <hi>The Devils alſo came out of many, crying out and ſaying, Thou art the Chriſt, the Son of God.</hi> And (6.) the moſt unprejudiced people, who could not be worſe than Devils, took this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous work of the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> to be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, xii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>Then was brought unto him one poſſeſſed with a Devil, blind and dumb, and he healed him: inſomuch that the blind and dumb both ſpake and ſaw. And all the people were amazed, and ſaid, Is not this the Son of David?</hi> By that name they called their KING, whom they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected with the power of working more miracles than any Prophet before had done, vii. <hi>John</hi> 31. And therefore (7.) when <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company were deſirous to hear of S. <hi>Peter all things that were commanded him of God,</hi> x. <hi>Acts</hi> 33. he refers them to this in the firſt place (after he had mentioned his being anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Holy Ghoſt and with power)
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:204181:209"/>as an argument why they ſhould believe in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that <hi>he went about doing good, and healing all that were oppreſſed of the Devil.</hi> And he offers himſelf together with others, as <hi>witneſſes of all things that he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jeruſalem.</hi> Which were the more wonderful I muſt add (8.) in the laſt place, becauſe he was a perſon of ſuch mean education. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like to <hi>Moſes</hi> in this, who was bred up in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, and acquainted with all the learning of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> But <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> was bred up privately and in an homely manner, having no advantages at all from a liberal inſtitution. Which was the cauſe that the people of his own Country, who knew how he had been trained up, <hi>were astoniſhed, ſaying,</hi> xiii. Matth. 54, 55. <hi>Whence hath this man this wiſdom, and theſe mighty works? Is not this the Carpenter's Son? is not his Mother called Mary? and his brethren James and Joſes, and Simon and Judas? And his ſisters, are they not all with us? whence then hath this man all theſe things?</hi> That is, do not we know him and all his kindred? How comes he to be wiſer and more powerful than they? His parentage is poor; his breeding was in a Carpenters houſe; he never learnt of any of the Doctors and Maſters in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> nor
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:204181:210"/>was otherways diſciplin'd than we our ſelves; where then did he learn his skill? and who gave him this power?</p>
                        <p>This was a juſt cauſe of <hi>astoniſhment,</hi> but none at all of <hi>offence,</hi> as S. <hi>Matthew</hi> in the following words, <hi>ver.</hi> 57. tells us it proved. That which made them ſtumble, ſhould have rather drawn them to him, and wrought faith in them; when they ſaw ſuch wonderful things done, and ſuch excellent things ſaid, by one that could not have them, unleſs it were from God. It could be no part, they might eaſily think, of the Devils craft, to diſpoſſeſs himſelf; and therefore they ought to have concluded that he was the enemy of the Devil; and indeed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of him, whom God promiſed to ſend into the world. And ſo they would have concluded, had not their eyes been blinded with the ſplendour and pomp of this world, and with the love of riches, and ſuch like things. Which made them readier to follow a man that by the force of arms, and their aſſiſtance, promiſed to ſubdue the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, than him, who by one word ſpeaking, they ſaw could caſt out Legions of Devils. Which naughty temper of mind, is that which
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:204181:210"/>ſtill prejudices men againſt the faith, and makes their hearts indiſpoſed to receive Chriſtianity. They prefer the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and love their bodies better than their ſouls: otherwiſe they would find themſelves inclined to believe in the name of Chriſt. If they conſidered what God is, what honour is due unto him, and what it is that will make a Soul truly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and deſired this above all other things; they would preſently ſee that none ever glorified God ſo much as our Saviour; none ſo plainly taught the world what worſhip, honour and obſervance is to be given to him; none ever ſo contrived the improvement and happineſs of our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits: and ſo they would be diſpoſed to hearken with due reverence and ſerious attention, to what theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him. Nay, did they but pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently conſult the good of their bodies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and had reſpect not merely to their preſent ſatisfaction, but to their perpetual felicity; it would certainly provoke them to examine carefully the Teſtimony which God hath given him; becauſe he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to change theſe vile bodies, and make them glorious, <hi>by that power whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf.</hi> And there is not the leaſt reaſon to doubt of his
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:204181:211"/>power now that he is in Heaven, ſince it was ſo miraculous while he was here upon Earth, that He frequently raiſed the dead. Which is the ſecond thing of which I am to ſpeak a few words.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. And there is nothing of this kind like to that of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his riſing to life again, after he had been dead four days, and was already ſo far putrified, as his friends thought, that they diſſwaded our Saviour from having his Tomb opened, leſt it ſhould prove offenſive and noiſom to him. For with this S. <hi>John</hi> concludes all that he had to ſay of our Saviours miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous works; there being nothing that could be thought of beyond it. For it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entred into the mind of any man to think, that a perſon really dead, as <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> undoubtedly was, could be reſtored to life by any power but that which gives us life, the power of Almighty God. And therefore our Lord plainly deſigned this, as the laſt thing he could do for their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction while he was on Earth, to prove that he was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> Elſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> had not died, but he would have gone and prevented it, as he did in many other caſes. For when he heard that <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> was ſick, he would not ſtir from the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:204181:211"/>place where he was, notwithſtanding the love he had both for him and for his two ſiſters. So S. <hi>John</hi> obſerves when he tells us, xi. <hi>John</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Now Jeſus loved Martha, and her ſister, and Lazarus. When he had heard therefore that he was ſick, he abode two days still in the ſame place where he was.</hi> This is a ſtrange reaſon for his making no more haſte, being at a great diſtance alſo from him. One would think that he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>THEREFORE he began his journey preſently into Judea, that he might come time enough to ſave him whom he loved.</hi> But he reſolved the quite contrary, <hi>becauſe the Son of God was to be glorified by this ſickneſs, ver.</hi> 4. Therefore he ſtayed ſo long before he would move towards him, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might be dead before he got to <hi>Bethany:</hi> and He might get more <hi>glory</hi> by his reſurrection, than he had done by healing ſo many ſickneſſes, and caſting out ſuch a number of Devils. For this proved that he had power not only to break, but utterly <hi>to destroy the works of the Devil,</hi> and to tread him quite under foot, who had the <hi>power of death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For which reaſon he tells his Diſciples that he was glad for their ſakes that he was not there when <hi>Lazarus</hi> died, <hi>to the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:204181:212"/>intent they might believe, ver.</hi> 15. Have their faith, that is, more confirmed in him, by ſeeing ſuch an illuſtrious miracle wrought upon <hi>Lazarus</hi> after he was dead, than it could have been by healing his ſickneſs, and preſerving him from death. They had ſeen many deſperate diſeaſes cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but never any man raiſed to life after he had been ſo long dead. Some of the <hi>Jews</hi> indeed objected this to him, that he ought to have been ſo kind, as to have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his friends life, if he had had the power which he pretended. <hi>Could not this man,</hi> ſay they, <hi>which opened the eyes of the blind have cauſed that even this man ſhould not have died? ver.</hi> 37. They do not by theſe words expreſs their Faith, but their unbelief: and upbraid him with weakneſs or want of love. The latter could not be imputed to him, for by his tears, juſt before mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 35, 36. they all obſerved how much he loved him. But from thence ſome of the company took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to diſparage his power, and to ask the reſt of their neighbours, how they could believe that he had opened a blind mans eyes (as was commonly reported, Chap. ix.) when he ſuffered one, whom he loved ſo much, to want his help and periſh? If he had done the former, how
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:204181:212"/>eaſie had it been for him to do the latter? In which he failing, though his affection could not but move him to do his utmoſt for his Friend, they took it to be a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that he was not ſuch a mighty Man as the People imagined. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe reaſoning moved our Saviour very much, ſo that he <hi>groaned again in himſelf</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 38.) to ſee their deplorable obſtinacy and malice; as much as he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (<hi>v.</hi> 33.) to hear their pitious lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they made for the dead. Theſe mens condition was far more pitious; becauſe he foreſaw there was but little hope, that they would be moved, when they ſaw their frivolous cavil anſwered, by the Reſurrection of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Which would ſhow there was good reaſon why he let him dye; that he might expreſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the leſs love to <hi>him,</hi> but more to <hi>them</hi> and to all Mankind by reſtoring his life, which was a more Divine work by much, than to have ſaved him from Death.</p>
                        <p>To this therefore he immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himſelf and bids the Siſter of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, whoſe faith it ſeems began to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, not doubt but ſhe ſhould <hi>ſee the glory of God,</hi> verſ. 40. ſuch a ſtupendious inſtance, that is, of the power of God in him, as
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:204181:213"/>would move many to give glory to God that ſent him. For wherein could the Majeſty of God appear more to their aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, than in ſuch a marvailous work as this? which when he entred upon, he firſt lift up his eyes to him and called him <hi>Father;</hi> on purpoſe that the People might believe he came from God and was his Son, when they ſaw him anſwer his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in this manner: <hi>verſ.</hi> 41, 42. Where, if you read the place, you will ſee he gives this reaſon why he made a publick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment to God, for hearing him ſo often: not becauſe he doubted of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with him now; but meerly that the by-ſtanders might know, by whom he did ſuch miracles, and aſcribing them to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power but his, might believe that he had ſent him. What ſhould they believe elſe; when they heard him, after this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to God, commanding <hi>Lazarus</hi> with <hi>a loud voice</hi> (expreſſing his aſſurance and authority) to come forth: and when they beheld him who could not lately move himſelf in his Bed, riſe up out of his Tomb, and walk about, not only reſtored to life, but in perfect health? This ſtruck the hearts of many of the <hi>Jewes</hi> who were there preſent ſo powerfully, that <hi>they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on him,</hi> verſ. 45. that is, concluded
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:204181:213"/>he was more than a <hi>Prophet,</hi> no leſs than the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> himſelf. And thoſe Cavillers before mentioned, who ſtill perſiſted to maintain their infidelity by the abſurdeſt imaginations, were ſo ſtartled at it; that they went preſently and told ſome of the Great <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> what <hi>Jeſus</hi> had done; wiſhing them, I ſuppoſe, to look to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not ſuffer theſe proceedings, <hi>verſ.</hi> 46. For they were ſo alarmed with this news, that a Council forthwith is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and they enter into a ſolemn Debate what courſe to take with him; ſeeing plainly how powerful this Miracle was to win him Proſelytes, and draw the People to him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 47. It had had that effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many already, as you have heard: and they were afraid it would increaſe the number of his Diſciples ſo much; that it would prove their utter ruine. For they ſay, verſ. 48. <hi>If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him; and the Romans ſhall come and take away both our place and Nation.</hi> That is, the People will proclaim him their King, and thereby we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the indignation of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> who will ſend an Army, and cut us off, till he leave neither root nor branch (as it is, iv. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.) but deſtroy both us and our Temple. That <hi>place</hi> they were reſolved to preſerve,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:204181:214"/>though it were with his deſtruction: whoſe death they now determine, as ſoon as ever they could catch him. For ſo their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation ended; firſt they decreed (<hi>v.</hi> 53.) that for the publick good, as they called it, He ſhould be put to death; and then that if any knew where he was (<hi>v.</hi> 57.) they ſhould give notice of it, that he might be apprehended in order to his trial. Thus their blind malice turned the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means of their converſion, into the ground and reaſon of his deſtruction. For becauſe he did ſo many miracles (<hi>v.</hi> 47.) they did not think it fit to let him live; when-as for that very cauſe they ought to have believed on him, and thought him worthy to live eternally. For, I think theſe <hi>Three</hi> things are very conſiderable, wherewith I ſhall conclude this part of the <hi>SPIRITS</hi> teſtimony.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. Firſt, this Miracle wrought upon <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> was ſo evident a token, that he was the Son of God; that it had in it all the conditions, which the <hi>Gentile</hi> King, whom the <hi>Jews</hi> ſpeak of in the Book <hi>COSRI</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8.</note>, requires in a prodigy, ſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to believe that God ſpeaks by him that works it. <q>Our mind, ſays he, cannot be brought to think that God
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:204181:214"/>enters into ſociety with fleſh and blood, unleſs it be by ſuch a miracle, whereby the nature of things is inverted: ſo that it appears it could not have been done by any power, but only by his who is the author of Nature, and made all the things we ſee, out of nothing at all. And <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> this miracle muſt not be wrought in ſecret, but, to gain belief, it muſt be done before the eyes of a multitude; who may ſee it, and be ſatisfied of the truth of it. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> diligent inquiry muſt be made, and it muſt be examined ſtrictly; that no doubt may be left in mens minds, but they may be fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied it is no fancy, nor done by any trick or ſubtile impoſture.</q> Now if we conſult this Hiſtory of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> we ſhall find there is none of theſe wanting, to ſettle the moſt doubtful mind in the belief of our Saviours Almighty power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For to raiſe the Dead is a work that exceeds all natural powers. There is none that can reſtore life, as has been ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, but he who at the firſt gave it. So much the <hi>Jewes</hi> themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; who have a common ſaying, that the <hi>Key of the Grave</hi> is one of the <hi>four</hi> keys, which is kept in the hands of the Lord of the World alone. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <pb n="404" facs="tcp:204181:215"/>Neither to Angel, nor to Seraph (as the Jeruſalem <hi>Targum</hi> ſpeaks upon xxx. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.) that is, neither to loweſt, nor the higheſt of the Celeſtial Miniſters is this power given: but it is reſerved to him onely that made them and all things elſe.</p>
                        <p>Now that our Saviour indeed raiſed a dead man, there were many witneſſes, as you heard before, from xi. Joh. 45. where it is ſaid, that <hi>many of the Jews which came with Mary, and had ſeen theſe things which Jeſus did, believed on him.</hi> And the fame of it was ſo great, that it drew a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of People thither to be ſatisfied of the truth of the report. For he tells us, xii. 9. <hi>that much People</hi> (i. e. a multitude) <hi>of the Jews came to that place, not for Jeſus his ſake only, but that they might ſee Lazarus alſo, whom he had raiſed from the dead.</hi> Nay, the Phariſees, as I told you, had the news of it brought to them by ſome that were preſent, <hi>and had ſeen the things which Jeſus did</hi> (xi. 46.) who were curious enough, no doubt, to inquire into the buſineſs; and had ſatisfied themſelves that indeed he was dead, laid in his Grave, and continued in that ſtate till according to the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he muſt begin to turn to corruption
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:204181:215"/>and ſtink. Which was all that needed any proof; for that he was now alive their eyes were witneſſes. And therefore they could not deny this miracle, verſ. 47. But to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the light, and take away the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing power of it; they thought it was beſt to remove <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the way, and to put him to death as well as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. For the ſight of him converted a great many, as you read xii. 10, 11. <hi>The chief Prieſts conſulted, that they might put Lazarus alſo to death. Becauſe that by reaſon of him many of the Jews went away, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on Jeſus.</hi> It was a thing confeſſed then, that this wonderful work had been done. There was the teſtimony of the man himſelf, and of his Siſters, and of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Diſciples, and of <hi>MANY of the Jews, who were come to comfort Martha and Mary concerning their Brother,</hi> xi. 19. In ſo much that not long after, our Saviour coming to the Feaſt of the Paſſover at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>Much people went forth to meet him,</hi> and brought him in with a triumph due only to ſo great a Perſon, ſaying, <hi>Hoſanna, bleſſed is the KING of Iſrael, that cometh in the Name of the Lord,</hi> xii. 12. And if you would know what excited them to meet him; it was the fame of this miracle, which the eye-witneſſes of it had brought to them;
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:204181:216"/>as you read there, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raiſed him from the dead, BARE RECORD. For this cauſe the people alſo met him, for that they heard that he had done this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here, it is viſible, were two Troops or Companies, both called <hi>much people:</hi> one of which went from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Bethany</hi> to ſee <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> had raiſed from the dead, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. The other met <hi>Jeſus</hi> the next day as he was coming from <hi>Bethany</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem, ver.</hi> 12, 13. For they had been informed by thoſe who were preſent at the time when it was done, that for certain <hi>Lazarus</hi> was raiſed from his grave by the word of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and now they were confirmed in this belief by the company that went to <hi>Bethany</hi> the day before to enquire of it, who teſtified to theſe that came to meet him, that they found it to be an undoubted truth, that he had been really dead and now was alive again, by no other means but thoſe words of his, <hi>Lazarus, come forth,</hi> which might well make them all acknowledge him to be their KING, who was come unto them <hi>in the name of the Lord,</hi> as appeared
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:204181:216"/>by this miraculous work which none but the hand of Heaven could effect. What heart would not be moved to bow to him, who had ſuch power over quick and dead? who could think him to be leſs than the Lord of all, who they ſaw was the Lord of life? None but proud ambitious <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who were afraid they ſhould loſe as much authority as he got. Theſe were more ſtartled than ever to ſee ſuch crouds of people flock after him to do him honour; and to hear them applaud him as the great <hi>Son of David,</hi> and follow him with their <hi>Hoſanna's in the higheſt.</hi> This made them deſpair of blaſting his fame, and diſcredit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with the people, as long as he lived; and therefore they grew the more reſolved to haſten the execution of their decree againſt him, that he ſhould be put to death. For <hi>they ſaid among themſelves,</hi> as you read in the following words, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world</hi> (that is, vaſt multitudes) <hi>is gone after him:</hi> followed him, that is, as their KING, notwithſtanding all that had been done to diſparage him. They are forced here to ſpeak more truth than they were aware of, that it was in vain to oppoſe him. For even when they had killed him, <hi>they perceived</hi> preſently
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:204181:217"/>
                           <hi>that they prevailed nothing:</hi> but found this literally true, that indeed <hi>the world went after him.</hi> Men of all Nations, and not the <hi>Jews</hi> only, followed him zealouſly, and became his Diſciples; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcandal of the Croſs, which they had caſt in their way to diſcourage them. Of which there immediately follows in this ſtory, an illuſtrious preſage. For ſome <hi>Gentiles</hi> deſiring to ſee our Saviour (<hi>ver.</hi> 20.) there came a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, upon his prayer that God would glorifie his own Name, ſaying, <hi>I have both glorified it, and will glorifie it again, ver.</hi> 28. The glory of God, that is, had appeared lately (as I have explained it before) in the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which had drawn many of the <hi>Jews</hi> to him; and he promiſes ſhortly to make it appear more brightly by raiſing up <hi>Jeſus</hi> from the dead, which would draw alſo many ſuch <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> as theſe to believe on his name.</p>
                        <p>To conclude this, that which the above named <hi>Jewiſh</hi> writer pretends in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he appeared and did his wonders in an age when the world was full of wiſdom and knowledge, is a great deal truer of our bleſſed Saviour. For as he rightly notes
<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Sepher Coſri Par.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 63.</note> that <hi>Learning still went
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:204181:217"/>along with the Monarchies;</hi> ſo it never was at a greater height than in the greateſt Empire, that of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and in the higheſt pitch of that Empire, when our Saviour appeared. Upon which account there cannot be any ſuſpicion of fraud in this or the reſt of our Saviours miracles, which were not wrought in an ignorant age, nor in an obſcure and barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor in ſome blind corner of the Country; but openly, near a famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (for <hi>Bethany</hi> was hard by <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) where there were profeſſors of wiſdom; and in a time when men could eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between a real miracle and a mere deluſion. This therefore ought to have opened their eyes to ſee who he was, whoſe miraculous works they could not but ſee. And it is juſtly mentioned to their eternal reproach, in the concluſion of this ſtory, xii. <hi>John</hi> 37. that <hi>though he had done ſo many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him.</hi> For they could not with any colour aſcribe them to any power but that of Gods; who hereby told <hi>them</hi> what the voice from Heaven told <hi>him,</hi> that <hi>this was his beloved Son in whom he was well pleaſed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. And truly there can no good reaſon
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:204181:218"/>be given (which is the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing that I told you ſhould be conſidered) why the Apoſtles ſhould ſpend ſo great a part of the ſhort Hiſtory they have left of his Life, in relating his miraculous works, if they had not both known them to be evident and notorious things, which all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try could witneſs, and likewiſe eſteemed them mighty demonſtrations, that he was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> Why elſe are they ſo large in deſcribing his cures of ſeveral ſorts, with the manner of them; if they were not ſure that they could not be contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if they did not deſire they ſhould be carefully heeded; and concluded like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that if they were, men would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be the CHRIST, whom God had ſanctified and ſent into the world to declare his will to them? Which belief, if it were once rooted deeply in their hearts, the Apoſtles knew very well would irreſiſtibly conſtrain them, to be obedient to him in every thing. This is that which gives his words ſuch authority, which makes them ſink into our hearts, and poſſeſſes them of our very Souls, and turns all other opinions and perſwaſions, which are inconſiſtent with them, out of doors; a belief that our Creator ſpeaks unto us by his mouth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="411" facs="tcp:204181:218"/>They were well aware, that it was no eaſie thing to perſwade the world of this, but that men might juſtly doubt of ſo ſtrange a report. <q>For there is ſuch a vaſt diſtance between God and us (as the <hi>Jews</hi> make that <hi>Gentile</hi> King <hi>Coſar</hi> diſcourſe, in the foremention'd Book called after his Name) that a man will be apt to think the Majeſty of Heaven will not enter into ſuch familiarity and friendſhip with fleſh and bloud, as to talk with them. Before we can believe this, ſays He, we muſt ſee prodigies, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and behold the courſe of nature inverted, by ſuch aſtoniſhing works, as can be done by none but him that created all things. And it is well, if after all this, the mind of man will reſt ſatisfied, that the Lord of the World, the Lord of the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, the Lord of Angels as well as all inferiour Creatures, will have ſociety with ſuch vile clay, ſuch contemptible dirt as we are.</q> And therefore as the <hi>Jew</hi> in that Diſcourſe with him declares how God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated his preſence with <hi>Moſes</hi> by mighty miracles, ſeen by all the people, and by their enemies too; which were the fitteſt argument for God to uſe, far
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:204181:219"/>beyond the little reaſonings and diſputings of Philoſophers: even ſo the Apoſtles prove to us that God was in our Saviour, and that we ought to believe what he ſays of himſelf, or concerning us, by enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating many of the mighty wonders which he did in the midſt of the people; wonders that amazed all beholders, and of which they could give no account, but that God was with him, and ſpake by him as his Son; elſe he could not have done thoſe things which ſo much exceeded all the power of Creatures, nay, all that his own power had wrought for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his ſervant <hi>Moſes.</hi> It was unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that they ſhould in thoſe days ask any greater tokens of a Divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and when they did, our Saviour told them they ſhould have none but the ſign of the Prophet <hi>Jonas,</hi> that is, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, of which I ſhall ſpeak preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And it is as unreaſonable in us now, to expect any thing ſhould be better atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than this truth, That our Saviour did all thoſe things which the Apoſtles have recorded. We have them reported from thoſe that ſaw them, and that had all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to examine them, from thoſe that beheld more of them than they could number; men of great fidelity and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:204181:219"/>vertue; men that had no intereſt ſo great as this, to declare the truth for the good of mankind, whatſoever they loſt by it. Unleſs we will demand that Chriſt ſhould come again in every Age, and alſo work his wonders in every Nation, in every place, before every particular mans eyes; we can have no better aſſurance than we have of theſe things. Now how abſurdly unreaſonable is he who will not be ſatisfied without ſuch a new deſcent of our bleſſed Saviour from Heaven continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally repeated; and unleſs he may ſee him crucified afreſh before his eyes? For men may as well disbelieve that part of the ſtory as all the reſt, and require that they may ſee all thoſe barbarous cruelties and indignities which we read of, acted over again upon our Saviour perpetually, to the end of the World. The very mention of which as it is horrible, ſo ſhould it be done, it would deſtroy the very nature of faith: which is the receiving of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon report. And that is one ſure way of conveying the notice of things to us, which we could not otherwiſe know. And things ſo made known, if the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes be good, are accounted by all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to be as ſufficient a ground to proceed upon, in the moſt conſiderable actions of
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:204181:220"/>humane life, as the knowledge of them by ſeeing, feeling, and by the reſt of our ſenſes is.</p>
                        <p>Let us therefore receive the Teſtimony of the Apoſtles of our Lord; ſeeing there is no exception (as you may hear more before I have done) that lies againſt their perſons, with any ſhadow or colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Let us perſwade our ſelves that this is a true Hiſtory which they have written, and then we have no faculty of diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, if we cannot conclude who our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was. He could not poſſibly have done ſuch things, as the blind man well argued, when his eyes were opened by him, ix. <hi>John</hi> 31, 33. <hi>if he had been a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi> that is, a deceiver, and not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by God to come in his Name. If he had been a mere pretender to this dignity, God would not have honoured him on this faſhion, nor have given countenance to a lye, by as great miracles as can be wrought for the proof of any Truth. He would not have deprived himſelf of all means to declare his will to us, as he muſt have done, if he had ſuffered ſuch a vaſt number of miracles to be wrought by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver for three years together, and given the moſt honeſt-hearted men no means to
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:204181:220"/>diſcover the cheat. We cannot believe him to be wiſe, and to have a care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his own authority, and to ſupport his government, and not think that he would ſome way or other have controuled the deſignes of a perſon of ſuch high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, if he had oppoſed <hi>Him,</hi> and come without his conſent, as his only begotten Son, into the world. In brief, if all theſe things be true which are reported, then our Saviour was <hi>God manifeſted in our fleſh;</hi> and you know what regard and reverence is due to ſuch a perſon: And that they are true, we have not the leaſt reaſon to doubt, being reported by <hi>eye witneſſes of his majeſty and power;</hi> who were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his Divine authority that they ventured their fortunes and lives in his ſervice, merely to promote his honour. And as that whereby they perſwaded others to believe in him was the power of the SPIRIT working ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles by their hands, and the power of the HOLY GHOST in divers other wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful gifts: ſo it was the ſame SPIRIT that firſt convinced them, and made them confidently conclude, that he was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> For the firſt time that we find they made a ſolemn acknowledgment of him, was upon the working of a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:204181:221"/>before S. <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> heard the voice from Heaven, when they were with him in the holy Mount. He had fed, you read xiv. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> five thouſand men, beſide women and children, with five Loaves and two Fiſhes. And as ſoon as he had done, <hi>straight-way conſtrained his Diſciples to get into a ſhip, and go before him unto the other ſide</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 22.) leſt they ſhould joyn with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the deſign which he ſaw they had in hand (vi. <hi>John</hi> 15.) <hi>to take him by force and make him a King.</hi> When he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed the multitude, and ſpent the reſt of the day in prayer, he overtook his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples in the midſt of the Sea, in the fourth watch of the night, and found them toſſed with the waves, becauſe the wind was contrary, xiv. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24, 25. They were afraid at the firſt ſight of him, and imagined it had been a Ghoſt: who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they thought had raiſed that ſtorm. But when he ſpake to them, and bad them be of chear, and ſaid, <hi>It is I, be not afraid; Peter</hi> was deſirous, if it were he, that he would call him to him, and enable him to walk upon the water with him. And ſo he did, as if it had been firm land, till his heart began to fail him, when he ſaw the wind boiſterous. But then our Lord put
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:204181:221"/>forth his hand and kept him from ſinking: and both brought him ſafe to the ſhip, and made a calm. Upon this, <hi>They that were in the ſhip</hi> (that is, the reſt of the Diſciples) <hi>came and worſhipped him, ſaying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God, ver.</hi> 33. The ſudden ceaſing of the wind, that is, his coming to them upon the water, his bearing up <hi>Peter,</hi> and making him walk along with him, and that when the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the water was not plain, but very rough by the croſsneſs of the wind, and his feaſting alſo great multitudes with little proviſion; made them conclude without any more ado, that he was greater than any man ever was. Their minds were overcome by this mighty power of God in him, which ſubdued their underſtandings perfectly to the faith, and ſo bowed and inclined their hearts, that they could not but proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at his feet, and acknowledge him to be the anointed of God. They believed no doubt before that he was a great <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> and a <hi>teacher ſent of God</hi> (as <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> did) nay, had ſome beginnings of faith that he was the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> (i. <hi>John</hi> 41, 45.) But it was not till now that they were ſure of it, and did him honour as, <hi>of a truth,</hi> or certainly, <hi>the Son of God.</hi> And
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:204181:222"/>they were no eaſie People, that believed lightly and fooliſhly, only out of love of novelty, or ſome ſuch vain humour: but were convinced and overpowred by the hand of God, which was ſtretched out to work ſuch wonders as theſe, whenſoever <hi>Jeſus</hi> pleaſed.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. And therefore he had great reaſon (which is the third and laſt conſideration) when any diſputed or doubted of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to refer them, as he doth very often, to his miraculous works for a proof of it: and he appeals to them as one of his <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> according as <hi>S. John</hi> here calls them, when he ſays the <hi>SPIRIT beareth witneſs.</hi> So you read in ſeveral places of his Goſpel; where you find that when the <hi>Jews</hi> incircled him, as if they would not let him ſtir till he told them plainly whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was the <hi>CHRIST</hi> or not, x. Joh. 24. <hi>He anſwered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Fathers name, they bear WITNESS of me.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I have no more for the preſent to tell you, than I have told you often by my <hi>works.</hi> If you can ſee nothing in theſe to convince you that I am the CHRIST, all my telling you ſo in <hi>words</hi> will be to no purpoſe, but for the preſent you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:204181:222"/>in unbelief. To the ſame effect he diſcourſes again in the ſame Chapter, verſ. 37, 38. <hi>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not</hi> (though I ſhould ſay never ſo oft, I am his Son) <hi>But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the WORKS: that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him.</hi> And thus he reaſons with <hi>S. Philip,</hi> xiv. Joh. 10, 11. <hi>Believeſt thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I ſpeak unto you I ſpeak not of my ſelf: But the Father that dwelleth in me, he doth the WORKS.</hi> (a clear ſign he ſpake not of himſelf, and that he was moſt nearly one with the Father) <hi>Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or elſe believe me for the very WORKS ſake.</hi> And ſo he tells all his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that the Jews were inexcuſable upon this account, becauſe they did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him for the Son of God, though he did ſuch miracles as <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets never did, xv. Joh. 24. <hi>If I had not done among them the WORKS which none other man did, they had not had ſin:</hi> (in not <hi>receiving</hi> him as their Meſſiah, the Son of God) <hi>but now they have both ſeen</hi> (by thoſe WORKS which he did) <hi>and</hi> (yet) <hi>hated both me and my Father.</hi> They could not endure ſuch a Meſſiah as he was,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:204181:223"/>though ſo divinely impowered; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently had no love to God, who had ſet ſuch plain marks and characters of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation upon him. Of which his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine works were the chief; for he alledges theſe (as S. <hi>John</hi> here in his Epiſtle doth) as the laſt witneſs and evidence to him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, v. Joh. 36. <hi>But I have a greater witneſs than that of John; for the WORKS which the Father hath given me to finiſh, the ſame WORKS that I do, bear WITNESS of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</hi> Yea, when <hi>John</hi> himſelf ſent his Diſciples to know of him whether he was the <hi>CHRIST,</hi> he plainly ſhows that he lookt on this as a greater teſtimony to him than that of their Maſter; which they had received already: and therefore gives them no other anſwer but this; <hi>Go, and ſhew John again thoſe things which ye do hear and ſee: the blind receive their ſight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleanſed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raiſed up, and the poor have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel preached to them,</hi> xi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4, 5. Where though he mention his heavenly doctrine, yet he chiefly inſiſts upon the Witneſs of the SPIRIT, as moſt apt to affect them: and <hi>in that very hour,</hi> when they came to be reſolved, as S. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, vii. 21. <hi>He cured many of their infirmities and plagues,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:204181:223"/>and of evil ſpirits, and unto many that were blind he gave ſight.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This he thought could not but ſatisfie them, if they would believe their eyes; eſpecially if they would believe alſo what they <hi>heard,</hi> that he raiſed up the dead. He could not now give them a clearer and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler teſtimony of his Divinity: and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed ſo much upon this evidence, that when he had cured a Man ſick of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, he told the Scribes that he looſed him from the chain of his ſins; and reſtored him to health, and bad him ariſe and walk, now that he was pardoned, on purpoſe <hi>that they might know the Son of Man hath power on EARTH to forgive ſins,</hi> ix. Matth. 6. That is, to take away all <hi>temporal</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is due to ſin; as after his death and reſurrection, when he came to HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEN, he had power to take away the <hi>Eternal,</hi> and to give life Immortal. Now who could have ſuch a power but God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the Scribes ſay very well upon this occaſion? ii. <hi>Mark</hi> 7. Who could grapple with the Devil, the <hi>Prince</hi> the <hi>God of this World</hi> (xii. Joh. 31. 2 Cor. iv. 4.) but only He who is God bleſſed for ever, as Jeſus appeared by theſe miraculous works to be? And indeed it is very remarkable that He
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:204181:224"/>wrought his miracles frequently, juſt as God Almighty brings things to paſs. <hi>God,</hi> ſays <hi>Moſes, ſaid, Let there be Light, and there was light. He ſpake,</hi> as the Pſalmiſts words are, <hi>and it was done, he commanded and it stood fast.</hi> In like manner did our Saviour ſay to the Leper, viii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>Be thou clean: and immediately his Leproſie was cleanſed.</hi> And to the foul ſpirit, ix. <hi>Mark</hi> 25. <hi>Come out, I charge thee, thou dumb and deaf ſpirit:</hi> and the ſpirit cryed and came out. And to <hi>Lazarus, Come forth; and he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes.</hi> Which was a notable evidence that indeed he was the Son of God; ſince he acted ſo like to the Father Almighty. This was ſo well known that when the <hi>Centurion</hi> came and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him for a ſick Servant of his, who lay in grievous torments, and our Saviour promiſed to come and heal him; He mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly declines the acceptance of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, in a ſenſe of his unworthineſs to have him come under his roof, and deſires him that he would SPEAK THE WORD ONELY, and he believed his Servant ſhould be healed, viii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. The firſt Cure that we read particularly related be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of the Leper aforementioned (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) and wrought by a <hi>Word;</hi> He hoped, it is
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:204181:224"/>like, that his Servant might be cured as eaſily, without giving our Saviour the trouble of coming to his Houſe, and laying his hands on him for his recovery. Though, by the way, we may note; that herein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared alſo his great power, that as he could heal (if he pleaſed) without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo he could heal at a great diſtance. Yea, the Woman that did but touch (not him, but) the very hem of his Garment (v. <hi>Mark</hi> 29.) had vertue or power (that is, ſomething from the SPIRIT that was in him) communicated to her, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored her to perfect health. What doth all this note, but that he who wrought ſuch things; ſo eaſily, ſo readily, in any place, and on all occaſions, was indeed the Son of God? He ought to have been honoured as the Author, becauſe he was the Reſtorer of humane nature. There was great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to acknowledge ſo great a Benefactor to Mankind to be more than a man; for none but God either could or would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſuch bleſſings.</p>
                        <p>It may be ſaid indeed that <hi>Moſes</hi> and ſome of the Prophets wrought Miracles; and yet cannot thence be concluded to be perſons of ſuch quality. But it may as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be anſwered, that their miracles were
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:204181:225"/>nothing comparable, either in their Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or Greatneſs, to thoſe of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. For the Multitude, remember how S. <hi>John</hi> concludes his Goſpel, in which he hath recorded ſome of them: <hi>And there are alſo many other things,</hi> ſays he, <hi>which Jeſus did, the which if they ſhould be written every one, I ſuppoſe that even the World it ſelf could not contain the Books that ſhould be written.</hi> For <hi>he went about,</hi> as hath been often ſaid, <hi>doing good,</hi> and filled every place with ſo many miracles of his mercy; that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine into how many Volumes it would have ſwell'd, if a record of every one of them had been taken. And as for the greatneſs and the quality of them, you find ſome, among thoſe which S. <hi>John</hi> hath ſet down, which were never heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince the World began, ix. Joh. 32. which might well make our Saviour ſay, as I noted juſt now, that <hi>he had done among them the works that no man did,</hi> xv. 24. <hi>elſe they had not had ſin;</hi> that is, he could not have charged them with the guilt of refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to believe him to be the Son of God, becauſe it would not have been ſufficiently proved. But this is not all the reply that may be made to this exception: it is far more conſiderable, that Jeſus affirmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the Son of God; to which dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:204181:225"/>neither <hi>Moſes</hi> nor the Prophets ever pretended. The end of miracles, was to prove the truth of that which the perſon that wrought them delivered. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as their miracles demonſtrated the truth of that meſſage which <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets brought from God: So our Saviour's evinced the truth of <hi>his;</hi> which was that they were only the <hi>Servants,</hi> but He the <hi>Son</hi> of God. This was as ſtrongly atteſted by what he did; as any thing the Men of God taught in former times, was by their works. Yea, his miracles bare as fair a proportion in their bigneſs and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to this high and great thing which they were to prove, that he was Gods Son: as the miracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets bare to thoſe leſſer truths which they were brought to eſtabliſh.</p>
                        <p>And here for to put a period to this part of my diſcourſe, it will be very uſeful to obſerve the different way of proceeding for the eſtabliſhing and promoting a Religion inſtituted by men, and a Religion whoſe author is God. This I find very well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to my hand in a learned Writer of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, whom I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Sepher COSRI. Part</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 80, &amp;c</note>. When men, ſays he, make Laws and ſetle a Religion, whoſe original is from
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:204181:226"/>their own minds, and deviſed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; though they may pretend that it comes from God, yet they are not able to make it take place, without the power of the Sword, or the countenance and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſome Prince who by his Authority ſhall cauſe it to be received. But a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is indeed Divine, is planted in a Divine manner. When Laws are derived from God, he eſtabliſhes them by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and might, and over-aws men by ſuch wonders, as without any humane force pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure obedience. Thus, ſays he, our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on began. When the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in grievous ſervitude, and when the Land promiſed to their Fathers was in the hand of potent Kings; God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> armed with no power, but that of working miracles, changing the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and uſual courſe of Nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting in a moment grievous plagues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Water, the Earth, the Air, the Plants, the Beaſts, and the Bodies of Men, throughout all the Land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Prince that kept them in bondage was forced to let them go. And in their Journey they were conducted by the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of a bright Cloud, and they paſſed through the Sea, and they were fed with Manna in the Wilderneſs XL. Years; and
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:204181:226"/>ſaw one Miracle after another, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them they ought to ſubmit to that Word of the Lord which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. To this purpoſe that Writer very rationally diſcourſes. Now juſt as He ſhows that <hi>Moſes</hi> proved his Miſſion from God; ſo I have briefly related how our Saviour likewiſe demonſtrated that he was the Royal Prophet, whom <hi>Moſes</hi> foretold God would ſend into the World. In an Age, when they not only groaned under the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, but were alſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly inthral'd to a number of Rites and Ceremonies deviſed by their Elders, ſuperadded to all the burden of the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and moreover grievouſly <hi>oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Devil,</hi> as all the reſt of the World likewiſe were, far more than they; God raiſed up a mighty Salvation to them out of the houſe of his ſervant <hi>David.</hi> Our Lord, that is, on a ſudden appeared as a Redeemer and Deliverer from the bondage in which they lay; not with any worldly policy or force, but meerly with the Spirit and Power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 5. who ſent an Herald, but without the power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, to proclaim his coming. And as ſoon as he had done <hi>crying,</hi> his mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtopt by <hi>Herod</hi>'s throwing him into Priſon, our Lord preſently came forth;
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:204181:227"/>ſhining moſt gloriouſly in the illuſtrious works that he did every where: which were ſuch as that time called for, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his miracles were proper to the occaſions and neceſſities of his days. And ſome of them were very like thoſe wrought by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and others bear as great a reſemblance to them, as twins are wont to do to each other, who lie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame womb. He healed more than <hi>Moſes</hi> killed. He turned their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into wine, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did the water of the River into bloud. He walkt upon the very ſurface of the Sea, and called one of his Diſciples to accompany him there. He fed multitudes with a little quantity of bread, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had fed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs. This he did more than once, and that in a Deſart too; ſhowing what he was able to do, if there had been the like need, that there was in former times. Then they ſhould not have asked <hi>what ſign ſheweſt thou</hi> (equal to <hi>Moſes</hi> they mean) <hi>what doſt thou work?</hi> vi. <hi>John</hi> 30. For it was plain enough he could have fed them forty years in that manner as well as once; which was the thing they ſeem to deſire, when they ſay in the next words, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. <hi>Our Fathers did eat. Manna in the Deſart, as it is written, He gave them bread
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:204181:227"/>from Heaven to eat.</hi> That is, He did not feed them for one day or two (as thou haſt done) but a long time, and that from Heaven; let us ſee thee do ſo, that we may leave him and follow thee. And if he had not done enough already to work faith in them, and they had lived now alway in a Deſart, as their Fathers did then, no doubt he <hi>would;</hi> for that he <hi>could</hi> was evident, elſe how ſhould he have fed them thus miraculouſly at all? Many other miracles alſo declared that he had the ſame power in the Air, that he had on the Earth, and could as eaſily have brought bread from Heaven, as multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Loaves which had now filled ſo many of them. The very Devils were as ſubject to him as the meaneſt creature in the World. And He raiſed the Dead by his powerful word, which <hi>Moſes</hi> never did. All which is recorded by the Apoſtles to ſhow what cauſe they had to believe in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and how his Religion was planted and propagated in the world, as the other wonders are recorded by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> to ſhow with what authority he came, and how he ſetled the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of his Laws. And there is no more cauſe to queſtion whether <hi>Jeſus</hi> be the Son of God, the Lord of the World, who came
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:204181:228"/>with ſuch a SPIRIT, than there was then to doubt whether <hi>Moſes</hi> was his ſervant and the Lawgiver of that people among whom he did ſuch wonders. Nor ſo much neither, for the greater his pretences were, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon there was that they ſhould have been diſcountenanced by ſuch a SPIRIT as was in him, if they had not been true. It is incredible that God ſhould let the world be abuſed ſo long, by ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and ſo great, that never was the like, without any the leaſt confutation; and abuſed by a lye of ſo dangerous a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo reproachful to his Name, and ſo directly oppoſite to his Government, which this Perſon (if he were an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, and ſaid he was his Son whom we muſt worſhip, when he was not) ſought to overthrow, and take out of his hands. We are ſecure that God would not have abetted an Uſurper, in ſo high a manner, againſt himſelf. And as for any unclean Spirits, if they could have done ſuch things as <hi>Jeſus</hi> wrought, they would not have employed their power, we are ſure, to eſtabliſh a Doctrine ſo pure and holy as the Chriſtian Religion teaches, which utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroys all that wickedneſs in which they delight. There was all the reaſon in the World to believe one who came thus
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:204181:228"/>by the SPIRIT, when he came by WA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER too; and by his mighty power pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted nothing but the moſt excellent Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Vertue and Goodneſs among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                        <p>But concerning the miracles of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour there will be an occaſion to ſay ſo much, in purſuance of what I deſign, hereafter; that I ſhall add no more of them here. Let us now proceed (having heard what the SPIRIT did <hi>by him</hi>) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what wonderful things it did <hi>for him:</hi> whereby it proved him to be the Chriſt, the Son of God.</p>

                        <p>And the SPIRIT ſure very eminently bare witneſs of him, when it raiſed him from the dead, and not long after advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him into Heaven, to live for ever with God. For both theſe are aſcribed to the power of the SPIRIT, in expreſs texts of Holy Scripture. Of the former you read in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 18. where the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>He was put to death in the fleſh</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mortal as we are) <hi>but quickned by the SPIRIT;</hi> that is, raiſed up again from the dead by that Divine power in him,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:204181:229"/>whereby he had raiſed up others before he died. It was impoſſible that he ſhould be held by the chains of death, who had ſuch a SPIRIT in him. By this he ſhook them off more eaſily, than <hi>Samſon</hi> brake the Withs or the Cords wherewith he was bound, when the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> of the Lord came mightily upon him. And being thus quickned again, the ſame <hi>SPIRIT</hi> alſo preſented him to God in the Heavens, as his dearly beloved Son, in whom he was well pleaſed; who had given him full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and done his whole will, for which he ſent him into the world. So you read in the ix. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 14. where the <hi>offering</hi> which, the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>he made of himſelf to God, through the eternal SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT,</hi> was that bloudy ſacrifice on the Croſs, which after his Reſurrection he offered to God, and continues ſtill to offer in the Heavenly Sanctuary: as the High Prieſt under the Law offered the bloud of beaſts, after they were ſlain at the Altar, in the moſt holy place of the Earthly San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary. And this oblation is ſaid to be made by the <hi>SPIRIT,</hi> becauſe that raiſed him to life after he was ſlain, tranſlated him out of his mortal condition, carried him on high, made his body glorious and immortal; and having thus made him fit
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:204181:229"/>to be for ever with God, preſented him unto his Majeſty, where he remains, <hi>through the power of an endleſs life,</hi> a Prieſt for ever after the order of <hi>Melchiſedek.</hi> And <hi>this working of the mighty power of God, which wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places, far above all principalities and powers, might and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and every name that is named;</hi> was ſuch a teſtimony of the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> to him, that it confounded his adverſaries more than all the miracles which he had wrought by the power of the ſame <hi>SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT</hi> in his life-time. And therefore the Apoſtles, I obſerve, alledge this immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the other, as that which <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> to him.</p>
                        <p>Till this was clear and evident, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied wholly upon the other, as you may perceive by the diſcourſe of thoſe two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples that went with our Saviour to <hi>Emaus.</hi> Who doubted of his Reſurrection after news had been brought them of it, but acknowledged him to have been a <hi>Prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;</hi> and upon that account were much troubled that their Rulers had
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:204181:230"/>crucified him, becauſe they truſted it had been he which ſhould have redeemed <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> xxiv. <hi>Luke</hi> 19, 20. When they were fully perſwaded therefore that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed made alive again (as theſe very men preſently ſaw) then they add this as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the greateſt force to convince the world, that he was the Son of God, the Redeemer of mankind. This is the ſubſtance, I obſerve, of both S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s firſt Sermons to the <hi>Jews</hi> and to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> He begins with a relation how great <hi>Jeſus</hi> was in his Life, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to ſhow how much greater God had made him by raiſing him from the dead. Read but what he ſays to his Crucifiers on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> ii. <hi>Acts</hi> 22, 23, 24. where he firſt tells them that <hi>Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth was a man approved of God among them by miracles, and wonders, and ſigns, which God did by him in the midſt of them, as they themſelves very well knew:</hi> And then, that he being <hi>delivered to them, and by wicked hands crucified and ſlain, God had raiſed him up, having looſed the pains of death, becauſe it was not poſſible that he ſhould be holden of it.</hi> In like manner he diſcourſes to the firſt <hi>Gentile</hi> converts, x. <hi>Acts</hi> 38, 39, 40. where he tells <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his friends, how <hi>God anointed Jeſus of
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:204181:230"/>Nazareth with the Holy Ghoſt, and with power; and how he went about doing good, and healing all that were oppreſſed of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, of which they were witneſſes, who had ſeen all that he did both in Judea and in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:</hi> and then adds that <hi>God raiſed him up the third day, after he was ſlain and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a Tree; and ſhewed him openly, though not to all the people yet, to witneſſes choſen before God, even to him and others, who did eat and drink with him after he roſe from the dead.</hi> The Apoſtle had nothing to add beyond this, which was the greateſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> to him. Now it ſpake with a loud voice in his behalf: for if he had not been God's Son (as he ſaid he was) He would never have taken him out of his grave, much leſs have advanced him into the Heavens. Where it was manifeſted he now lived, by the coming of the HOLY GHOST; which fell upon <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his friends, while S. <hi>Peter</hi> was ſpeaking thoſe words. This was all that could be added to what the Apoſtle had ſaid; and God ſent this to prove his Reſurrection and Exaltation at his right hand. Which was ſuch an undeniable proof of his authority, that having thus raiſed him, the <hi>SPIRIT,</hi> as I ſaid, finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its teſtimony to him. For how ſhould
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:204181:231"/>it ſpeak plainer or more convincingly? or who can think that it would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ſpeak for him, in this manner, after his death, if he had died with a lye in his mouth? The <hi>SPIRIT,</hi> which S. <hi>John</hi> here ſays, is the TRUTH, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared by reſtoring him to life, that his Bloud was moſt acceptable to God. It ſhowed that it was no common thing, but the BLOUD of the <hi>Holy one of God.</hi> It witneſſed to that WITNESS, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that as he did not ſpeak contrary to his knowledge, ſo he did not ſpeak contrary to the truth. And if the SPIRIT could not be believed in this, it would have loſt all its credit, and never have been belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more; we could never have known any thing by the greateſt wonders it can work, if ſuch things had been done for a deceiver, as it is apparent were done for <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For that he was raiſed up to life again, we are aſſured by the teſtimony of the Apoſtles, and by the teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt; of which none can reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly doubt, as it were eaſie to ſhow, if it were not my preſent buſineſs rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that this was an irrefragable teſtimony of the SPIRIT to him, a moſt
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:204181:231"/>powerful means to beget faith and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in mens minds that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Son of God. It was for this very end, that S. <hi>John</hi> wrote the Hiſtory of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the ſeveral ſigns and tokens they had of it, as he tells us in thoſe words, xx. <hi>John</hi> 30, 31. <hi>Many other ſigns truly did Jeſus in the preſence of his Diſciples, which are not written in this Book. But theſe are written, that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his Name.</hi> For this plainly reverſed the ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation which the <hi>Jews</hi> had paſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. It ſhowed that he was acquitted in a far higher Court than that, which judged him worthy of death. Whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree it reſcinded, and openly declared that he was no Blaſphemer, when he ſaid he was the Son of God. If he had, God would have been more concern'd than they to have kept him faſt in his grave for ever: that there, ſo great a lye might have been buried together with himſelf.</p>
                        <p>For the further clearing of which, it will be fit to conſider briefly theſe <hi>three</hi> things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that before he died, he promiſed his Apoſtles that he would riſe again, and gave this alſo as a ſign to all
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:204181:232"/>the people, whereby they ſhould know that he was the Chriſt. And, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that he declared this to be the greateſt ſign he had to give of it. And, <hi>thirdly,</hi> that his very enemies confeſs it is a ſufficient ſign and ſatisfactory teſtimony of any truth.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. For the firſt of theſe, that it was a ſign promiſed to his Apoſtles, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the people; there is nothing more eaſie to be obſerved in the Goſpel ſtory. For he tells his Apoſtles very often that they ſhould ſee him betrayed and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but on the third day he would riſe again. No ſooner had S. <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed that he was the CHRIST, but <hi>from that time forth Jeſus began to ſhew them, how that he muſt go to Jeruſalem, and there ſuffer many things, and be killed, and be raiſed again the third day,</hi> xvi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. For he would not have them expect a <hi>Chriſt</hi> that ſhould reign here on Earth, but in Heaven. And till he went thither, he would not have them ſo much as preach that he was the CHRIST, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. And what he had ſaid here at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats again when they were in <hi>Galilee,</hi> xvii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22, 23. And again when they were going up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> xx. 19.
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:204181:232"/>And not many hours before he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, he ſaid again, <hi>A little while and ye ſhall not ſee me: and again, a little while and ye ſhall ſee me, becauſe I go to the Father,</hi> xvi. <hi>John</hi> 16. At which words they were greatly troubled, becauſe they minded more what he ſaid about his death, than they regarded his reſurrection which was to follow. But the greater their trouble was then, the greater their ſatisfaction was afterwards, when they ſaw him alive again. The leſs diſpoſed they were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, the more confident they grew when they ſaw ſuch a wonder. They wept and lamented when he was gone, as he told them they would (<hi>ver.</hi> 20.) But when he came to ſee them again, their heart rejoyced with ſuch a joy, as none could diſpoil them of, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. The ground of which joy, you ſhall ſee preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when I have alſo remembred you how he foretold his Reſurrection to the people, as a teſtimony that he was the CHRIST. It was their wont in all Ages, and with great reaſon, to ask for a ſign that a man was ſent of God. And therefore now that <hi>Jeſus</hi> came with ſuch authority, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs many abuſes among them, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that Nation and Temple, they ask him <hi>what ſign ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:204181:233"/>that thou doeſt theſe things?</hi> ii. Joh. 18. He had given them ſigns enough already, and therefore makes no other anſwer but this (to let them know what ſhould be the laſt ſign.) <hi>Deſtroy this Temple</hi> (pointing to his own body) and <hi>in three days I will raiſe it up,</hi> verſ. 19.</p>
                        <p>From whence we may ſafely argue, that Jeſus having given this as a ſign and token whereby it ſhould evidently appear, more than by all his miracles, that he was the Son of God; the Almighty would never have fulfilled this promiſe and prediction, if He had uſurped his authority, and taken upon him to be his ANOINTED, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave. Nothing was more eaſie than to quaſh all his pretences, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed upon his Reſurrection; without which his Apoſtles, as I told you, had no authority to Preach that he was the <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It had been but letting him rot in his grave, as all men naturally do, when they are dead; and all the World would have been of the mind of the Phariſees, that he was a Deceiver. And God ſure hath not ſo little care of the World, as to deny them ſuch ready and obvious means of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, about the moſt important truth. We ought to think rather, that he would have
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:204181:233"/>concerned himſelf to ſee, that this Temple, which he ſpake of, ſhould lye for ever in its ruines, and be turned to duſt and aſhes. He, who alone could do it, would have been ſo far from rearing it up again, that he would have provided, it ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned, and made the vileſt rubbiſh in the World. But there being very good proofs, <hi>many infallible proofs</hi> (as S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks, i. Act. 3.) that it was quite otherwayes, and that indeed it was raiſed after three days, as he had told the People; it was a Teſtimony from God moſt high, that He dwelt in that Temple, and that it was his Holy place, where he manifeſted his glory. He declared to them by this that Jeſus was no Deceiver, but that they ought to believe he was the Chriſt of God. For that a man ſhould be raiſed from the dead, by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power than that of God's; all the World concludes is impoſſible. If any of thoſe lying ſpirits, which love to cheat and abuſe the world, could do ſuch feats; why do we not ſee this frequently happen: that ſo they might break the force of this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and overthrow our belief? Above all things they ſhould be concerned, one would think, to work this wonder; for then we ſhould be forced to confeſs, that there is nothing ſo eminent and ſingular in
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:204181:234"/>this thing, as to move us to give credit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus. But ſince it never has been done, but only in this inſtance; and it was alſo a fulfilling of his word, when he gave it as a token of this truth; we have reaſon to conclude as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did after he had ſeen him alive, that <hi>this is very CHRIST.</hi> Upon this ground it was that the Apoſtles ſo much rejoyced, <hi>when they ſaw him again;</hi> for now, as S. <hi>John</hi> tells us, ii. 22. <hi>when he was riſen from the dead, they remembred that he had ſaid this unto them</hi> (concerning the raiſing up the Temple of his Body) <hi>and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jeſus had ſaid.</hi> Now they were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured they had not been deluded, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their aſſent, all this while, to a fancy. They ſaw clearly that he was their KING, though he had been vilely diſgraced and crucified. And therefore, when they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him again, after his Reſurrection, they did not lament and mourn as they had done before; but <hi>worſhipped him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Jeruſalem, with great joy: and were continually in the Temple, praiſing and bleſſing God,</hi> xxiv. Luk. 52, 53.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. But it is time to add, that as it was a <hi>ſign,</hi> which he gave them before-hand of this Truth, ſo he told them, it was the
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:204181:234"/>
                           <hi>greateſt ſign</hi> which he had to give. He had done many things in his life time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he was the <hi>CHRIST:</hi> But ſtill they were ſo perverſe, as to ask for more ſigns of it. Though he had done more miracles than ever <hi>Moſes,</hi> or all the Prophets had done from the beginning; yet the Phariſees continue to ſay, <hi>Master, we would ſee a ſign from thee,</hi> xii. Matth. 38. One would think they had a mind to learn of him, ſince they call him <hi>Maſter;</hi> but it was only a complement, as <hi>S. Luke</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, xi. 16. And therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour calls them, <hi>an evil and adulterous ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> who were degenerated from the manners of their pious anceſtors; for they were contented with leſs proofs of that which God required them to believe, and would have been aſhamed to <hi>ſeek after a ſign,</hi> as theſe men did, after ſuch evident tokens of a Divine preſence in him, as they beheld. Why ſhould he gratifie men of ſo naughty a humour, whom nothing would ſatisfie, but <hi>a ſign from Heaven,</hi> which <hi>S. Luke</hi> ſays they demanded? nor would be convinced then neither, he clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by their frivolous cavils at all that he had already done. Therefore he tells them, <hi>no ſign ſhall be given them, but the ſign of the Prophet Jonas</hi> (which was not a
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:204181:235"/>ſign from Heaven, but from the bowels of the Earth) <hi>For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the Whales belly: ſo ſhall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth,</hi> verſ. 39, 40. Which was as much as to ſay, It is in vain to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the conviction of ſuch corrupt and depraved minds as yours are, by ſuch means as theſe. And therefore, I muſt tell you, all that is remaining for the opening your eyes and conquering your perverſneſs, is my Reſurrection. As <hi>Jonas</hi> was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly reſtored again to live upon the earth, after he had been ſwallowed up by a <hi>Whale</hi> in the Sea, and layn there <hi>three</hi> days; which was a notable ſign that he was a Prophet, and could not but obtain him credit with the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> when they came to the knowledge of this wonder: So will I be reſtored again to life, after you have killed me, and I have layn three days in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the earth; and if this will not ſatif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you, there is no other ſign to follow this for your conviction. But let me tell you (as he adds, <hi>verſ.</hi> 41.) if you ſtill perſiſt in unbelief when this is fulfilled, <hi>the men of Nineveh ſhall riſe in judgment with you and condemn you; for they repented at Jonas his preaching, and behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</hi> That is, though <hi>Jonas</hi> was not really
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:204181:235"/>dead, but only had his life wonderfully preſerved, yet the report of it wrought faith and the fruits of faith, repentance and amendment, in the hearts of the <hi>Ninevites;</hi> and what a condemnation will it prove to you, if after you have ſeen me actually dead, and it be demonſtrated to you that I am raiſed to life again, you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on me?</p>
                        <p>The very ſame thing is repeated again, xvi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. where, they having once more demanded <hi>a ſign from Heaven,</hi> ver. 1. He anſwers them, that they ſhould have none but this of <hi>Jonas: and he left them, and departed.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I have nothing more to ſay to you now: all that remains, is that I dye and riſe again, which is the laſt and greateſt token that I am the <hi>CHRIST.</hi> And indeed this was a ſign ſo great, that it gave force and ſtrength, to the other ſigns which had been given of this Truth. For in the next Chapter (<hi>Matth.</hi> xvii. 9.) we read, that Three Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles having been confirmed in this belief by a voice from Heaven, which ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed; hear ye him;</hi> Jeſus charges them, ſaying, <hi>Tell the Viſion to no man, until the Son of man be riſen again from the dead.</hi> Till
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:204181:236"/>He had taken poſſeſſion of his Kingdom and was ſet upon his Throne and thence ſent the Holy Ghoſt, He ſaw it would be to no purpoſe for the Apoſtles to publiſh this teſtimony of God the Father to him. For they had already ſlighted the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> who heard the like Voice from Heaven at his Baptiſm, and thereupon bare witneſs that Jeſus was the Chriſt: And therefore it was not likely, that they would liſten to the Apoſtles, when they came and teſtified that the ſame words were ſpoken in their hearing; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til their teſtimony ſhould be juſtified by the authority of ſuch a proof as this, that he was riſen from the dead. This would mightily back all that they ſaid; and make it undeniable by any, but thoſe who would ſtill deny his Reſurrection: which was wilfully and without any reaſon, not only to call them lyars, but to affront the Holy Ghoſt, who witneſſed together with them, that he was riſen from the dead. Which being a proof of ſuch ſtrength that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour relyed upon it above all other, it is manifeſt to common reaſon, that if there be a God (as we are ſure there is) who loves ſincerity and truth; he ſhould above all things, have taken order, that this ſhould not have had ſuch evidence as it
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:204181:236"/>hath, if indeed Jeſus was not his Son. Though he had ſuffered wonders to be done by him, and voices from Heaven had been heard, yet ſtill he gained not much belief in the moſt conſiderable part of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation: and therefore appealing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to this Grand Teſtimony, ſure there is no providence, or elſe it would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care, in caſe he had been a deceiver, that it ſhould have been as evident that he did not riſe from the dead, as now it is that he did. Though the World had been amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a long time with diſcourſes about him, and with ſtrange things which he was thought to do; yet here had been a nick of time at one ſtroke to have broken the force of all theſe arguments, and blaſted his credit, and undeceived the People, had there been nothing of God in it. But ſince this laſt and greateſt token did come to paſs, as was proved by witneſſes of unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truth, it juſtified his pretences, and added ſtrength to all the former teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which had been given to him: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating him plainly to have been <hi>a man approved of God among them, by miracles, wonders &amp; ſigns, which God did by him in the midst of them, as they themſelves knew.</hi>

                           <pb n="448" facs="tcp:204181:237"/>III. And this truly was ſo great a ſign, that his very Enemies could not but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it was ſatisfactory; and a ſufficient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of any truth. Which may be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern'd from hence, that they never, to this day, went about to ſhow that though he was raiſed again, yet it was not a proof that he was the CHRIST: but all their endeavour hath been to perſwade the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he was not raiſed again. They had no other way but to deny <hi>this,</hi> that ſo they might not confeſs the <hi>other.</hi> They were utterly undone, they knew, and muſt loſe all their reputation with the People, if he was raiſed from the dead (becauſe it would effectually prove what they denied) and therefore they hired the Souliders to ſay, that his Diſciples ſtole him away while they ſlept. A ſtory ſo ſillily contrived (as I hope to ſhow in another place) that it it is a very great evidence, they ſhut their eyes againſt this light, for fear it ſhould ſhow them that they had been the Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their CHRIST. They could not but ſay, that if he was raiſed again, he was the CHRIST; and therefore were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſay any thing, though never ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, rather than grant that he was raiſed to life again, which muſt ſtrike them dead.
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:204181:237"/>He was not a King for their purpoſe; and therefore they hated him and endeavoured by any means to obſcure whatſoever tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prove his authority. He never made any ſhow of worldly greatneſs, or gave them any hope he would fight their battles againſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> and therefore they entred into a league againſt him, to make perpetual war with him: and ſought by all the lyes they could invent, to ſuppreſs his growing Name, and by all the cruelties they had power to uſe, to diſhearten his followers from profeſſing their belief in it. But the Apoſtles of our Lord knowing the truth of this better than they could do, and that it was a meer calumny which they ſpread abroad concerning their ſtealing his Body out of the Sepulchre; could not be deterred by any puniſhment, which they or all the power on earth could inflict, from preaching <hi>Jeſus and the Reſurrection.</hi> For on the one hand they ſaw it was confeſſed by malice it ſelf, that if he was raiſed from the dead, it could not be denyed that he was the CHRIST; and on the other hand they ſaw, with their own eyes, that he was raiſed from the dead, and knew it was a malicious ſlander which the Phariſees had divulged, of their breaking open the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of the dead. This both confirmed
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:204181:238"/>their faith, and inflamed their zeal. If they had any doubts remaining, this very tale helpt to diſperſe them. But they were ſoon paſt all doubt by the coming of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſent them, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Reſurrection together with them. Then it was impoſſible they ſhould doubt of his being alive, when they felt his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power in their hearts. This diſſipated all the miſts and vapours, which had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered about them, and darkned their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings. By this Jeſus brake forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in a freſh luſtre: and like the Sun, rending all the Clouds in pieces, illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not only them, but the whole World, in a ſhort ſpace, with the beams of his Glory.</p>
                        <p>How ſhould he do otherways, after ſuch a proof as this; which is ſo great that they could never wiſh for a greater? It is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſix hundred years ago, ſince a Jew called EL DAVID, gave out that he was <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> and drew a great many follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers after him. Upon which he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and brought before an <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince, who askt him; <hi>What miracle, what prodigie doſt thou ſhow that we may believe?</hi> To which he anſwered, <hi>Sir, cut off my head, and I will live again.</hi> This he ſaid craftily,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:204181:238"/>to avoid greater torments which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw would be inflicted on him, for affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which he could not prove. But obſerve the Princes reply, (as it is related by <hi>Maimonides,</hi> in a letter of his to the Jewes at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> about this very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs:) <hi>Thou canst not give us a greater ſign than this. And if it fall out ſo, that thou dost riſe again to life after I have cut off thy head, I, and all my People (nay all the World ſure) will believe what thou ſayeſt is true; and that our Forefathers inherited nothing but vanity and lies, which did not profit them.</hi> And preſently the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made; He commanded him to be beheaded, and there was an end of his cheat. And ſo likewiſe there had been of this buſineſs which we are treating of, if Jeſus had not riſen. For he ſaid juſt as this <hi>El David</hi> did, Kill me, if you pleaſe; I will live again. Which ſign coming to paſs, as we have the greateſt reaſon to believe, we ought to follow the reſolution of the Prince now mentioned, by ſubmitting our ſelves to him, and heartily acknowledging him to be the Lord. When he was upon his Croſs, the Chief Prieſts, with the Scribes and Elders, ſaid, <hi>He ſaved others,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:204181:239"/>let him ſave himſelf. If he be the King of Iſrael, let him now come down from the Croſs, and we will believe him:</hi> xxvii. Matth. 41, 42. If our Lord had taken them at their word, we cannot tell what they would have done. But it is plain, he intended to give them a better ground of Faith than that. If they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a greater thing, they ſhould have had greater ſatisfaction. If they had ſaid, <hi>He raiſed others from the dead, let him raiſe up himſelf, after we have crucified him; let him come out of his Grave, if he be the KING of Iſrael;</hi> and then have uſed all the care in the World, to ſee whether he roſe again, or no: they had been convinced and perſwaded to believe on his Name. It was not fit to do the other, becauſe he was to Dye for the Sins of the People: But this he did, though they did not ask it, to fulfill his own promiſe, and to ſhow that he was the Perſon promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to their Fathers. And it is ſo much greater than the other, as it is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thing, to be made alive again after Death, than to ſave a Man's ſelf from dying.</p>

                           <pb n="453" facs="tcp:204181:239"/>I hope then I may conclude with the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that this piece of the Myſtery of Godlineſs is without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, <hi>God was manifeſt in the fleſh, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>

It hath acquitted him fully in all impartial mens thoughts, wiped off all the guilt which was caſt upon him, ſet him before the eyes of all the world as a perſon innocent and juſt; and made him glorious and <hi>great even in his bloud</hi> (as thoſe words may be rendred, xiii. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 20.) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal he is gone into the Heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there to appear before God for us: which he would not have been able, nor ever dared to do, if he were not fully <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> and perfectly a righteous perſon.
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:204181:240"/>This is that witneſs which our Saviour himſelf promiſes to <hi>Nathanael,</hi> as higher than that, which he had already received, i. <hi>John</hi> 50, 51. He was convinced of the Authority of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and acknowledged him to be the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe he could ſearch into the ſecrets of the hearts, and know men at a diſtance: But our Lord tells him he ſhould <hi>ſee greater things than theſe,</hi> even, <hi>behold the Heavens open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Angels of God, aſcending and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending upon the Son of man.</hi> That is, He ſhould have the witneſs of the SPIRIT, ſending the Angels to miniſter unto him, when he was raiſed from the dead, and when he was exalted unto Gods right hand in the Heavens.</p>

And ſo they did, as you read in the firſt of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10, 11. which proved him to be indeed <hi>the heir of all things.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now to ſhew a little more fully the greatneſs of this Teſtimony of the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT, and that it was greater (as <hi>Jeſus</hi> here ſaith to <hi>Nathanael</hi>) than the gift of diſcerning Spirits, which I called a gift of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>Spirit;</hi> let us conſider a little that ſpeech of our Saviours, xii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 31, 32. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:204181:241"/>I ſay unto you, all manner of ſin and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy, ſhall be forgiven unto men: but the blaſphemy of the Holy Ghoſt, ſhall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given unto men,</hi> &amp;c. Which heavy doom S. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us was pronounced upon them, <hi>becauſe they ſaid, he had an unclean Spirit,</hi> iii. 30. This ſhows what the blaſphemy was, in which if they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there was no hope of pardon. For if he by the <hi>SPIRIT of God cast out Devils</hi> (as he tells them, <hi>ver.</hi> 28.) then it was rank blaſphemy, the higheſt degree of evil ſpeaking and calumny, to impute theſe very cures and wonderful works to the power of the Devil, which were wrought by that Divine power. And this ſin was therefore unpardonable, which ſhows how great this teſtimony of the SPIRIT is, becauſe there were no means left to convince them that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the Son of God (without which belief their ſins could not be forgiven) if they perſiſted not only in denying the authority of the SPIRIT, but were ſo bold as to blaſpheme it. For what could work upon their hard hearts, if this proved ineffectual? might they not better deny the voices from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which they did not hear, than theſe wonderful works, which they beheld every where with their own eyes? Or
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:204181:242"/>might they not as well ſay that thoſe were deluſions, as call theſe works diabolical operations? Might they not in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſlight his power of knowing ſecrets, and impute it to ſome other skill? What is there in which they might not ſhuffle and reſiſt the light, if in ſo clear a caſe as this, <hi>Jeſus</hi> his oppoſition to the Devil, caſting him out of poſſeſſion, and that on purpoſe to eſtabliſh an holy doctrine, quite contrary to his intereſt, and in a number of other miraculous works, they would be ſo obſtinate as to ſay, the Devil himſelf had the principal hand. There is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to be made, but they who were ſo perverſe as not to ſee <hi>this finger of God,</hi> but continued blinder than the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Magicians, when it did ſo many wonders, would ſhut their eyes againſt any other means of conviction, which could not be expected (it muſt alſo be remembred) becauſe God himſelf had no higher evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to give them, than this of his <hi>SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But then you muſt not underſtand this ſpeech of our Saviour, as if he meant that thoſe perſons, to whom he ſpake theſe words, had run themſelves at that inſtant, into this unpardonable ſin: but that if
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:204181:242"/>they ſtill proceeded to blaſpheme it, when the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> had finiſhed its teſtimony (that is, done all thoſe things which ſtill were behind, for their conviction) then they would fall into it, and remain in it irrecoverably. For you muſt remember that under the word <hi>SPIRIT</hi> is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the power that raiſed Chriſt from the dead, and preſented him to God in the Heavens; that he might receive of him the promiſe of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which he ſhed upon the Apoſtles abundantly, as a witneſs of his Reſurrection and glorious Exaltation. If after this, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was riſen again from the dead, aſcended into Heaven, and ſhowed himſelf to be there by ſending the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> upon his Apoſtles, they did not believe, but ſtill blaſphemed the holy name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> of God, ſaying, That <hi>they</hi> were drunk who were filled with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as here they ſaid <hi>Jeſus</hi> had a Devil; then they were uncapable of obtaining re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, becauſe there was nothing more to be done for their converſion, but they muſt be abandoned to the hardneſs and impenitence of their hearts. This I am ſure muſt be the meaning, becauſe our Lord himſelf, after he had pronounced the <hi>Phariſees</hi> unpardonable, who ſpake
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:204181:243"/>againſt the <hi>SPIRIT,</hi> whereby he caſt out Devils, tells them expreſly that there was one ſign more remaining to convince them (which is a demonſtration they had not yet ſinned incurably, nor could not till that ſign was paſt) and that was the ſign, as you heard, of the Prophet <hi>Jonas, ver.</hi> 39, 40. which he grants them again, xvi. 4. ſhould not be denied them. Now every body underſtands by this, His Death, and Reſurrection, with thoſe things that followed upon it, the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt to enable his Apoſtle to go and teach all Nations, as <hi>Jonas</hi> went, after he came, as we may ſay, out of his grave, and preached to the great City <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh.</hi> But then this was ſtill the <hi>SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT,</hi> that was thus continued to them (by that our Lord being raiſed, and it working wonders alſo at his Death) which if they continued to reſiſt, when it had fully done the whole office of a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and was all poured forth, then they were under the abſolute ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. In brief, <hi>To blaſpheme the SPIRIT in this comprehenſive ſence of the Word (including the Reſurrection, and that which followed to prove it) was the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable ſin and none elſe.</hi> And thus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's meaning is to be expounded; if
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:204181:243"/>one ſhould <hi>ſpeak a word against the Son of man,</hi> (that is Him) deſpiſing him becauſe of his poor Parentage, and calling him the <hi>Son of a Carpenter,</hi> or ſome ſuch name; this, though blameable, might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, <hi>propter corporis vilitatem,</hi> as S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> ſpeaks, becauſe of the meanneſs of his outward appearance. Nay, if a man proceeded ſo far as to call him <hi>a glutton, a Wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> this alſo might find pardon, becauſe he did not hitherto ſpeak evil of the works proper to a God, but only of thoſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a man. And more than this, ſhould he call him <hi>deceiver</hi> or <hi>ſeducer,</hi> when he heard him teach the people; it would not be unpardonable, becauſe no man is to be believed merely upon his own word. But if when theſe men ſaw the mighty works of the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> juſtifying his preaching to be Divine, they ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to ſpeak evil of him; this was a very dangerous blaſphemy: becauſe they could not after this call him a ſeducer or falſe Teacher, but they muſt reproach the holy <hi>SPIRIT</hi> as well as him, and call that the work of the Devil, which was performed by the power of the Spirit of God. And if when the HOLY GHOST was come from Heaven upon the Apoſtles, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:204181:244"/>that he was <hi>quickned by the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT,</hi> and by the ſame <hi>SPIRIT</hi> preſented to God in the Heavens, they ſtill went on to ſpeak evil of him, then there was no hope of remiſſion, becauſe they blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the laſt remedy for their recovery, which was the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from Heaven to perſwade them to repent and believe on his name.</p>
                        <p>And that we muſt take our Saviour in this ſence, is further apparent from the name of the HOLY GHOST, which he uſes when he ſpeaks of this unpardonable ſin, never calling it the <hi>blaſphemy againſt the SPIRIT,</hi> but always the blaſphemy againſt the HOLY GHOST: which you know was not as yet given, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſpake theſe words. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this diſcourſe, xii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. he mentions only the <hi>SPIRIT.</hi> But then coming to deſcribe the danger of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it, he doth not ſay that the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> ſimply, that is, of thoſe preſent works of his was unpardonable: but that the blaſphemy againſt the HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY GHOST, when it was come, ſhould never be forgiven. Which muſt needs be underſtood, as I have already argued, concerning the contempt and reproachful
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:204181:244"/>uſage of thoſe following <hi>witneſſes,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, Aſcenſion, and the preaching of the Apoſtles endowed with power from on high; becauſe though the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> now wrought among them, yet the HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY GHOST was not come to be his ADVOCATE and plead his cauſe; and therefore could not as yet be blaſphemed by them. By HOLY GHOST then in our Saviour's language here, I ſuppoſe is meant all that was left ſtill to be done for his Juſtification; and that it is ſo wide a word in this place, as to include in it the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> alſo. For he was ſpeaking before of the <hi>SPIRIT,</hi> and therefore when he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the phraſe, he doth not leave out the teſtimony of that, but imbraces it within the compaſs of a larger word: which it was neceſſary to uſe, that he might ſhow when that ſin, which they had begun in a deſperate manner, would be ſo complete, that it could never be undone. And that was when the HOLY GHOST had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated the Apoſtles to their great office (which ſuppoſes his Reſurrection) and filled them with all Divine gifts: among which, you know, was a power (xiv. <hi>John</hi> 12.) <hi>to do greater works than theſe,</hi> which our Saviour is here ſpeaking of (called the <hi>SPIRIT:</hi>) Then if they did
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:204181:245"/>not believe there was no remedy; but they muſt periſh in their infidelity. But till then they, to whom our Saviour ſpeaks, were not arrived at this hopeleſs conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe they had hitherto only blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the <hi>SPIRIT,</hi> not the <hi>HOLY GHOST, which was not yet given, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Jeſus was not yet glorified.</hi> But when it was given, and they reproached that, as they had done the <hi>SPIRIT,</hi> then they were under irrecoverable condemnation: there being nothing more to be done for the opening their eyes, and perſwading them, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> They had made a fair ſtep to it in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's life-time, by reſiſting the mighty power of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> but it was poſſible they might ſee their error, becauſe there was ſtill a more mighty power behind, which firſt raiſed up and glorified <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and then enabled his Apoſtles to do more wonderful things, than he had done when he was on Earth.</p>
                        <p>And therefore I obſerve that afterward the word HOLY GHOST is ſometimes uſed in this large ſence, for all the Power that was given the Apoſtles, whether of Prophecy, and Languages, or of healing and caſting out Devils (which laſt are
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:204181:245"/>ſometimes peculiarly called the <hi>SPIRIT</hi>) and ſo not to be diſtinguiſhed from the other, which it incloſes. Thus the word HOLY GHOST in ii. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred not only to <hi>gifts</hi> immediately prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but to <hi>ſigns, wonders and miracles,</hi> before mentioned. And after S. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had cured a lame man, they ſay the HOLY GHOST was a witneſs to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> v. <hi>Acts</hi> 31. But though this word be ſo largely uſed in ſome places (as <hi>SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT</hi> alſo ſometimes ſignifies all the reſt, ii. <hi>Acts</hi> 4, 17. and ſometimes all but that which is called <hi>power,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 4.) yet commonly you will find the word HOLY GHOST having a peculiar reference to thoſe other gifts of Illumination, not of Power, iv. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. v. 3. vii. 55. x. 44, 45. and eſpecially xix. 2, 6. where you read that S. <hi>Paul</hi> found certain Diſciples at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who had not ſo much as heard whether there was any HOLY GHOST, who had heard no doubt of the miraculous works both of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Now when theſe and the HOLY GHOST were both joyned together; when <hi>Jeſus</hi> had given them the witneſs of his Bloud, and of his Reſurrection, and the Goſpel came <hi>not only in POWER,</hi> but in the HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY GHOST, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> i. 5.
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:204181:246"/>Then they who perſiſt to blaſpheme the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> were in an hopeleſs condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, paſt all the methods of God to bring them to forgiveneſs. All which I have ſaid, as diſtinctly as I could, to explain that which has perplexed ſo many, and to ſhow the ſtrength of this <hi>Witneſs:</hi> which our Saviour ſo much relied upon, that he knew not a greater to convince them, when once it had ſaid all that it intended in his behalf. To which let this be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as an argument of the greatneſs of this teſtimony, that they who apoſtatized from the Chriſtian Faith, are therefore condemned to a ſorer puniſhment than they who forſook <hi>Moſes,</hi> not only becauſe they accounted the <hi>BLOUD</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> an unholy thing, and deſpiſed that witneſs, but alſo <hi>did deſpite to the SPIRIT of Grace,</hi> which by raiſing him from the dead, proved his BLOUD to be the Bloud of the Son of God, x. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 29. This is ſet down laſt of all in that place, becauſe it filled up the meaſure of their ſin. This made them uncapable of the benefit of any ſacrifice for ſin (as it is, <hi>ver.</hi> 26.) that they ſo ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea, vilified and reproached, carried themſelves contumeliouſly (as the word imports) towards the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> of God, which was the greateſt Teſtimony on
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:204181:246"/>Earth that our Saviour had, and was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with the HOLY GHOST ſent down from Heaven. And they muſt needs be guilty of ſuch diſgraceful uſage of the <hi>SPIRIT,</hi> yea, of the <hi>SPIRIT of Grace,</hi> that Spirit which God had ſo graciouſly poured, not only upon <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but upon the Apoſtles, and perhaps upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if they did deny <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Religion: becauſe this was in effect to tell the world, that this was not the Spirit of God, but of the Devil, and that it did not prove his Reſurrection from the dead, but, whatſoever it ſaid, He was a blaſphemer, when he called himſelf the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus I have done now with this laſt <hi>Witneſs on Earth,</hi> the <hi>SPIRIT:</hi> which you ſee concurs and agrees with all the former in this Truth. There is not the ſmalleſt difference between them, nothing to make us ſuſpect them to be falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; for they are all found (to ſpeak in our vulgar phraſe) in the very ſame ſtory, punctually, and in terms affirming this, that <hi>Jeſus is the Son of God.</hi> This he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who never did any ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth; This <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt likewiſe proclaimed with a loud voice;
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:204181:247"/>The Bloud of <hi>Jeſus</hi> atteſted this before all the people; this was the very Title over his Croſs, that he was <hi>KING OF THE JEWS;</hi> and this the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> ſaid; it was the language of every one of his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works; and of his Reſurrection alſo and his Inthronization (of which the Holy Ghoſt gave aſſurance) which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to teſtifie this, and expreſly juſtified it to all the World. And therefore how can we chuſe but think this a ſure word [that he is the Son of God] which is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed out of the mouth not of two or three, but of twice three witneſſes, of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable credit. And theſe three laſt treated of, challenge from us a very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſideration, and we ought the more duly to weigh what they ſay, becauſe they were <hi>on Earth:</hi> and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, nearer to us, as I told you, more evident at firſt ſight, more ſtrongly atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by innumerable witneſſes, that they might ſerve for a greater confirmation, even of the truth of the reſt. The Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the FATHER is certain, becauſe it was heard by ſeveral excellent perſons; yea, once by a multitude of people. That of the WORD alſo is infallible, and we cannot with any reaſon doubt whether there was ſuch evidence, becauſe S. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
                           <pb n="469" facs="tcp:204181:247"/>S. <hi>Paul,</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> were perſons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted reputation, who heard it, and alſo did and ſuffered the hardeſt things upon the credit of it. That the HOLY GHOST alſo fell upon him at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, a great Prophet ſo confidently affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was prophaneneſs to deny it. But yet, excepting the Teſtimony of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> after his Aſcenſion, there were none of thoſe Witneſſes in Heaven heard by ſo many, as theſe three laſt mentioned, who, as S. <hi>John</hi> ſays, bare witneſs in Earth.</p>
                        <p>It was a notorious thing to all the Country (which <hi>Jeſus</hi> travelled) that he led a moſt holy life. No man could faſten the ſuſpicion of any crime upon him, but the cry of the people was, like that when he opened a blind mans eyes, <hi>He hath done all things well,</hi> vii. <hi>Mark</hi> 37. And yet he lived not a retired life; he did not hide himſelf in corners, nor ſhut up himſelf in private houſes: but converſed ſo freely, that they found fault with him (though unjuſtly) for being too familiar, and keeping company with Publicans and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And as for his BLOUD, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Witneſs on Earth, that was ſhed in the face of the Sun, at a great feaſt, when
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:204181:248"/>from foreign Countries they were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> All the accidents, which we ſay attended his death, were things that never have been contradicted. No man then had the impudence to deny the Eclipſe of the Sun, the Earthquake, the rending of the veil of the Temple, and the reſt of the aſtoniſhing things that then hapned. The firſt of them is mentioned by a Pagan-writer; and though the Apoſtles publiſhed both that and all the other continually, yet there is no book ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile</hi> (who were enemies great enough to his Religion) that goes about to diſprove them. And as for his <hi>miraculous works,</hi> they were generally done openly, at Feaſts, in the Synagogues, on the high-ways; and were ſo commonly talkt of, that the Rulers feared all the world would run after him, xii. <hi>John</hi> 19. Therefore the Apoſtles could not falſifie in the report of theſe things, but they might be eaſily confuted. Which no man ever attempted, but both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> acknowledged that he wrought Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; for his Apoſtles alſo wrought them every where, and ſo did their Succeſſors in ſome Ages after. To theſe the Ancient Chriſtians appeal, as an undoubted teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to their Faith: which they could
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:204181:248"/>not be ſo ſilly as to mention, were there any diſpute whether there had been Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought or no. His <hi>Reſurrection</hi> alſo was atteſted by Five hundred people, who ſaw him together at once; and it was proved beyond contradiction by the ſtrange deſcent of thoſe miraculous gifts upon his Apoſtles, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Which came upon them alſo at a Feaſt, when all the Nation, though li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in far diſtant Countries, were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together, and a great company of Proſelytes alſo, and devout people were preſent, to be witneſſes of it. Yea, the Apoſtles themſelves, as is notoriouſly known, went over all the world, and openly ſhowed the power of <hi>Jeſus</hi> which was in them.</p>
                        <p>Now if all theſe be true Witneſſes, or rather if you grant there were ſuch Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which no ſober man can deny (they being viſible here <hi>on Earth,</hi> in the company of ſo much people) there can be no doubt remaining of this, that <hi>Jeſus is the Son of God.</hi> They proclaim this ſo loudly with one voice, that S. <hi>John</hi> had reaſon to ſay, <hi>We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father.</hi> They beheld it in his Preaching and Life; they
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:204181:249"/>beheld it in his bloudy Death, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the power of his <hi>SPIRIT</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, and in raiſing him up from the dead: and they beheld it alſo, when they were with him in the holy Mount, and had the Teſtimony of the reſt of the Heavenly Witneſſes. Which were heard on Earth, though they were in Heaven; as men of high quality, and of unblemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed integrity, with the hazard of all they had, did conſtantly affirm. And though ſome of thoſe Heavenly Witneſſes might not be believed ſo much at the firſt (which is the cauſe, I ſuppoſe, that our Saviour bids his Apoſtles, as you have heard, not declare what the voice from Heaven ſaid, till after his Reſurrection, xvii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.) yet when they had received ſuch great teſtimony, that they were good men, and men of God, by having the Holy Ghoſt beſtowed on them, to beſtow upon others alſo; and when by this they were able to demonſtrate his Reſurrection; then all the reſt that they alledged, as a proof that he was the Son of God, did highly merit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief alſo, and there was no reaſon to ſuſpect the truth of ſuch reports, as were verified in ſo authentick a manner. For <hi>with great power gave the Apoſtles witneſs of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> iv. <hi>Acts</hi> 33. And
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:204181:249"/>the Reſurrection of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> was a powerful Witneſs, that there was nothing ſo great ſaid of him, by the voices from Heaven, but it ought to be received as the undoubted truth of God. Who at ſundry times, and in divers manners teſtified to his Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that by ſome means or other the moſt obſtinate hearts might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and thoſe tongues which blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, might confeſs him to be the Lord.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Concerning the Witneſs of the Holy APOSTLES of our Lord.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Know not what remains to be done for the full explication of theſe words of the Apoſtle, unleſs it be ſit to note that our Saviour is ſaid to COME not only in his own Perſon, but likewiſe in his Apoſtles and Evangeliſts. I need name but one place to prove this, ii. Epheſ. 17. <hi>And CAME, and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</hi> It is well known that Jeſus (of whom he there ſpeaks) was <hi>not SENT ſave to the lost ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael:</hi> and therefore in his own Perſon was not to go to thoſe who were afar off (ſuch Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles as theſe <hi>Epheſians</hi> were) to whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he is ſaid here to COME.
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:204181:253"/>
                        <hi>He came unto his own</hi> (ſaith this very Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple) and though his own received him not, yet he kept himſelf within the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of their Country; and charged his Diſciples, during his life, not to go into any City of the <hi>Samaritans:</hi> to whom he never went, but only in his paſſage from one part of the Jews Country to another. We can give no account then of his <hi>COMING to them that were afar off,</hi> as well as unto the Jews <hi>who were nigh,</hi> but only this; that by the Apoſtles whom <hi>he</hi> ſent, and who were <hi>his</hi> Embaſſadors to preach the glad tidings of Salvation, he was made known to the Gentiles; even as the Father is ſaid to <hi>come</hi> to the Jews and to ſpeak to them, when he ſent him, his Son, to declare his mind and will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
                     <p>Now it is poſſible that S. <hi>John</hi> might have ſome reſpect to his ſending them (as the Father ſent him) to prove him to be the Son of God; when he ſaith that <hi>Jeſus CAME by WATER and by BLOUD and by the SPIRIT,</hi> and that theſe three were <hi>his WITNESSES on Earth.</hi> For firſt the Apoſtles were his WITNESSES; as they are called in many places, both by him and by themſelves. <hi>Ye ſhall be WIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESSES
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:204181:253"/>unto me, both in Jeruſalem and in Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt parts of the Earth,</hi> ſays our Saviour, juſt before his Aſcenſion, i. Act. 8. The ſame he ſaid to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared afterward, xxvi. 16. xxii. 15. And in the ſame ſtile S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>I exhort you, who am an Elder, and a WIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS of the ſufferings of Chriſt,</hi> i. Pet. v. 1. And as they were witneſſes of his <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> ſo they were of all that he did (as you ſhall hear preſently) and of all that was done for him to prove that he was the Son of God, and the King of Glory. That is, they were witneſſes that there appeared ſuch witneſſes both in Heaven and Earth for him, as we have examined. And (2.) <hi>witneſſes</hi> they were of very great credit, worthy of all belief. For they were <hi>WIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESSES choſen of God,</hi> x. <hi>Act.</hi> 41. ſelect Men, pickt out by Heaven, ſome of them in an extraordinary manner, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And they ſpake nothing by hear-ſay, but upon their own certain knowledge; being <hi>eye-witneſſes of his Majeſty,</hi> as ye have heard before from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2. i. 16. And S. <hi>John</hi> ſays the ſame in this Epiſtle, iv. 14. <hi>We have ſeen, and do teſtifie, that the Father ſent the Son to be the Saviour of the World.</hi> Firſt they ſaw, and then
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:204181:254"/>bare witneſs: Or as he expreſſes himſelf more largely in the beginning of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>That which they had heard, and ſeen with their eyes, and looked upon, and which their hands had handled of the Word of life (for it was manifeſt, and they ſaw it and bare WITNESS) that</hi> (he repeats it again) <hi>which they had ſeen and heard, they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> unto the World. Why ſhould not ſuch witneſſes be believed; who ſpake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what all their ſenſes, that could be imployed in this caſe, gave them full aſſurance was undoubtedly true? They were Men ſure of common capacity; and they had opportunity alſo to ſee and hear and feel and examine every thing, which Jeſus did, or was done in honour of him. For therefore our Saviour choſe them to be his <hi>witneſſes,</hi> becauſe they were thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified. xv. Joh. 26, 27. <hi>When the Comforter is come, even the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He ſhall teſtify of me: And ye alſo ſhall bear WITNESS, becauſe ye have been with me from the BEGINNING.</hi> That is, becauſe you are abundantly informed, how all things have paſſed, from my very firſt entring into the World to preach the Goſpel; therefore you ſhall be imployed to teſtifie all things that you have ſeen and heard and felt, as
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:204181:254"/>the fitteſt perſons to be believed. For which reaſon, when they wanted one of their Number, by the apoſtaſie of <hi>Judas,</hi> they were very careful, according to this Rule of their Maſter, to chuſe ſuch an one to ſucceed him, as had been a conſtant fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of Jeſus, and had taken notice of every thing they were to witneſs. i. <hi>Act.</hi> 21, 22. <hi>Wherefore ſaith S. Peter, of thoſe men which have companied with us, all the time that the Lord Jeſus went in and out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, beginning from the Baptiſm of John unto that ſame day that he was taken up from us, muſt one be ordained to be a WITNESS with us of his Reſurrection.</hi> See here how exact they were in their choice, that there might be no exception taken againſt their teſtimony, if any one ſhould ask them; Did you your ſelf <hi>ſee,</hi> or did you <hi>hear</hi> this, which you report? They would have none to take a part with them in this chief Miniſtry of the Goſpel, but ſuch an one as had been with them from firſt to laſt, and was able to anſwer to ſuch a queſtion upon his own certain knowledge, that all was true which he preached. From them the <hi>Evangelists</hi> received their Leſſon; who could ſay that they had theſe things which they reported, from thoſe very Men who were preſent
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:204181:255"/>when they were ſpoken or done: And ſome of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> who were of the LXX. Diſciples choſen by our Saviour (x. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.) could affirm all upon the credit of their own ſight or hearing. But the other was ſufficient, as S. <hi>Luke</hi> thought; who undertaking to write the Hiſtory of our Saviour's Life and Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection (though he was none of the XII. Apoſtles) ſays, that he intended to declare thoſe things <hi>which were moſt ſurely believed among them,</hi> even as they were delivered to him, by thoſe Perſons, who <hi>from the beginning, were EYE-WITNESSES and Miniſters of the Word.</hi> i. 1, 2. Where it is obſervable, that as he would truſt only ſuch perſons as had been <hi>eye-witneſſes,</hi> ſo none but thoſe who had been ſuch wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes <hi>from the beginning.</hi> And (3.) what it was that they <hi>witneſſed</hi> (which is to be next conſidered) I have already told you in their own words, all that Jeſus did from the beginning, and particularly <hi>his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> which concluded all. This you may obſerve they teſtified to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> ii. <hi>Act.</hi> 22.32. how God had honoured him by <hi>Miracles, wonders and ſigns which he wrought by him in the very midst of them, as they could not deny:</hi> and <hi>this Jeſus,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Peter, hath God raiſed up,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:204181:255"/>whereof we are all WITNESSES.</hi> And ſo he preached to the Gentiles, as I have noted before, x. 39.41. <hi>We are WITNES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES of all things which he did, &amp;c. whom they ſlew and hanged on a Tree: Him God raiſed up the third day and ſhewed him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly unto WITNESSES choſen before of God, even unto us, who did eat and drink with him after he roſe from the dead.</hi> And ſo does S. <hi>Paul,</hi> xiii. 30, 31. <hi>But God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the dead, and he was ſeen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jeruſalem, who are his WITNESSES unto the People.</hi> He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges their teſtimony, I ſuppoſe, rather than his own (though he alſo had ſeen the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 8.) becauſe they had been with him <hi>from the beginning,</hi> which he had not: but <hi>was born out of due time,</hi> or was <hi>an abortive,</hi> as the word is well rendred in the Margin of that place now quoted. He was not formed, that is, and faſhioned as the reſt of the Apoſtles were under our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's diſcipline, nor grew by leiſurely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the Chriſtian Religion to the dignity of an Apoſtle; as Children come by degrees to perfection and maturity in their Mothers womb: but was thruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church on a ſudden, and by an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly violence, not in a regular way, made
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:204181:256"/>an Apoſtle when he was not at all diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for it. Being born an Apoſtle therefore thus late (after <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s aſcenſion) and thus haſtily (before he was informed by any Teacher of Chriſtianity) he could not ſay that he had ſeen all the wonderful works of Chriſt when he was alive, or heard his Sermons, or received the hiſtory of them from eye and ear witneſſes. But all this was ſupplied by this one wonderful work of his converſion, in ſuch a manner as I formerly deſcribed, and by thoſe inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he received immediately from Jeſus himſelf. This was ſo ſtrange a thing that it made him one of his prime Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; becauſe the Goſpel which he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>He neither received it of man, neither was he taught it, but by the revelation of Jeſus Christ.</hi> Who ſo fully ſatisfied and inform'd him; that there was no need to conſult any mortal Creature, nor to go for inſtructions or authority to thoſe who were Apoſtles before him: but immediately he went about his buſineſs, and became <hi>his WHNESS to all men, of what he had ſeen and heard:</hi> as you may read, i. <hi>Gal.</hi> 12.16, 17. xxii. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. And both He and the reſt (which is the chief thing to be conſidered) aſſerted that which they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, that is, proved <hi>Jeſus to be the Son of
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:204181:256"/>God with Power,</hi> all theſe ways by which S. <hi>John</hi> ſays our Saviour came, by WA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, by BLOUD, and by the SPIRIT: as will be evident, if I give you but a brief account of every one of theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And as for the Holineſs and <hi>purity</hi> of their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> I have given you an abſtract of it before. By which it is apparent, they taught nothing but ſuch a love of God, as made thoſe that learnt it the greateſt and moſt vertuous lovers of all Mankind. Whom they purſued with kindneſſes, even when they hated them; and prayed for and bleſt, when they perſecuted them and drove them away, and would no longer receive any of their other kindneſſes. For they were inſtructed by the Apoſtles to bear all injuries with perfect patience; to be contented with the preſent, and truſt God for the future; to live peaceably with the worſt natur'd people, and to exerciſe the divineſt Friendſhip with thoſe who were good. Whom they taught to <hi>be all of one mind,</hi> as much as the beſt Husbands and Wives are, <hi>to have compaſſion one of another, to be loving, pittiful and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;</hi> as you may read in 1. Pet. iii. 7, 8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="488" facs="tcp:204181:257"/>The reſt of their Precepts were like theſe; and their <hi>Lives</hi> were correſpondent: as all the World knew, who could never charge them with any fault but this (as they accounted it) that they preached Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. There was nothing appeared that could give the ſmalleſt ſuſpicion of any baſe or unworthy deſign, which they hid under pious and holy words. But their converſation had been very innocent and unblameable in the places where they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when they were <hi>private</hi> men. None could charge them with forgery, theft, covetouſneſs, or any other crime. But <hi>S. Paul,</hi> for inſtance, a moſt eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon among them, was of ſuch ſtrictneſs, during the time he was a <hi>Jew,</hi> that he was blameleſs, as to the righteouſneſs which their Law required. And when they were drawn out of their obſcure pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy, and ſent as <hi>publick</hi> perſons, to preach and act in the Name of Jeſus, they were ſo far from ſerving any worldly ends, that they took nothing for all their pains, nor demanded one farthing for any of their Cures. They were able not only to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge all the world, as that great Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> had done his Nation, that the man would come forth and witneſs againſt
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:204181:257"/>them, and ſay, if he could, whom they had wronged; but of whom they had expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any gratuity for all their kindneſs to them. That was all that <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid, <hi>Whoſe Oxe or Aſs have I taken? whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppreſſed? or of whoſe hand have I received any bribe? and I will reſtore it you:</hi> 1. xii. 3. And <hi>Moſes,</hi> in that great rebellion againſt him, xvi. <hi>Num.</hi> 15. thinks it ſufficient to purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſame manner, ſaying, <hi>I have not taken one Aſſe from them, nor hurt one of them.</hi> But <hi>S. Paul</hi> makes a more noble proteſtation, ſaying, <hi>I have COVETED no mans ſilver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, you your ſelves know, that theſe hands have miniſtred unto my neceſſities, and to them that were with me,</hi> xx. <hi>Act.</hi> 33, 34. Here was Vertue; which made him ſo far even from deſiring any thing of others, that he choſe by his own hard labour to be both his own benefactor, and his Families. And what he affirms of himſelf, he alſo tells us was the pious inclination of ſeveral of his Companions; ſuch as <hi>Silvanus,</hi> and <hi>Timotheus.</hi> Whoſe exhortation, the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians</hi> knew, <hi>was not of deceit, nor of uncleanneſs, nor of guile; for they studied not to pleaſe men, but God. Unto whom they appeal as their Witneſs, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:204181:258"/>uſed any flattering words, nor ſought to inrich themſelves, or to advance their own glory,</hi> as you read, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> ii. 3, 4, 5. And <hi>they were witneſſes,</hi> he adds, verſ. 10. <hi>as well as God, how holily, and juſtly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameably, yea, how lovingly</hi> (as it follows verſ. 11.) <hi>they behaved themſelves among them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now what ſhould tempt ſuch pious Men, who ſo much deſpiſed worldly goods, and ſought not to get any credit to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to preach that <hi>Jeſus was the Son of God;</hi> if they had not been very ſure of this truth, which was the conſtant matter of their Sermons, throughout the World? Is it likely that ſuch Men ſhould feign a ſtory of things, which they never heard nor ſaw? that all their talk of voices from Heaven, and Miracles, and appearances of Jeſus to them after he was dead, were only devices and contrivances of their own brain? For what end, I beſeech you, ſhould they invent them? If their tongues were ſo well hung, and they were ſo eloquent as to hope to perſwade the world to be of their mind, it had been wiſdome to have imployed them more for their own gain and advantage; and not to have preached ſuch a ſtrange and unprofitable Doctrine
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:204181:258"/>as this of the crucified Jeſus. There were far eaſier tasks to undertake than this, and which would have turn'd to a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count here on earth: and therefore they who had ſo much with as to invent, would have let this alone; had they not known it to be both ſure and undoubted, and alſo worthy of all their pains to reveal it, that this crucified Jeſus was the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>But beſides this it ought to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that from the very beginning our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had taught them to be content with a mean and poor kind of life, when he ſent them forth to preach in <hi>Judaea. Go,</hi> ſays he, x. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.9, 10. <hi>preach and ſay, the Kingdom of God is at hand.</hi> Freely you have received, freely give. Provide neither gold, nor ſilver, nor ſo much as a braſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in your purſes; nor ſcrip for your Journey; neither two Coats; neither ſhoes, nor yet ſtaves. For the Workman is worthy of his Meat: and eat ſuch things as they ſet before you. That is, be not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and, doubt not of it, God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for you. Was it likely that men thus bred, to ſo great plainneſs, ſimplicity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs, and dependence on God, ſhould go about to abuſe the world with falſe ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:204181:259"/>Nay, before they came to him, their education and way of life was ſo low and poor; that they were the unfitteſt men in the world to deviſe and make <hi>Romances,</hi> if they ſhould have had a mind to it. This was the very thing, the Heathens objected to them, that they were illiterate, not trained up in ſtudy, but got their living many of them, <hi>Piſcatorio artificio,</hi> as they ſpeak in <hi>Lactantius,</hi> by the trade and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of fiſhing. Of which He makes this advantage very juſtly, in his reply to them, <hi>Abfuit ergo ab his fingendi voluntas</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Inſlit. c.</hi> 3.</note>, &amp;c. <q>You muſt needs confeſs therefore that theſe Men had not the inclination, nor the craft to contrive and feign ſuch a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as this; becauſe they were ſo rude. Or what unlearned Man is there, that can deviſe things ſo coherent, and that ſute ſo well one with another? ſince e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the moſt excellent of all your Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, as we ſee plainly, have involved themſelves in many contradictions; and ſpoken things contrary and repugnant to what they have elſewhere delivered. <hi>For this is the nature of lies, that they never hang well together.</hi> One end of the tale, is wont to diſcover the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the other. But what they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>undique quadrat,</hi> perfectly agrees
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:204181:259"/>with it ſelf from top to bottom, becauſe it is true, and no device of their own. And then he adds (which is the greateſt evidence that can be of their honeſty) they could not invent this for the ſake of any thing in this world, (and without ſome ſuch reſpect what ſhould incline them to invent it) for as much as they both taught and followed that courſe of life which regarded not ſenſual pleaſures, and undervalued thoſe things, which the world admires and cries up for goods; and likewiſe they dyed for the Faith, which was not the effect of a raſh and ſudden fit of zeal, for they knew very well and foretold they ſhould dye upon this account; and they alſo reſolvedly ſuffered the moſt cruel and ſharpeſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that could be deviſed before they dyed; and they took it all patiently, nay gave God thanks that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for the Name of Jeſus.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this belongs to the Teſtimony of their BLOUD. To which before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, let me obſerve that the Apoſtles were not only men of great knowledge in the things of God, and very innocent and holy in their lives; but they were men extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:204181:260"/>qualified in both thoſe regards: and therefore are the more to be believed, in what they ſay they <hi>ſaw</hi> or <hi>heard.</hi> For what Philoſopher ever ſpake ſo plainly and clearly of all things that concern the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of Mankind, or gave them ſuch hopes in the World to come, without which it was not likely they ſhould amend, as theſe poor Fiſhermen did? They wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing but their eloquence, which they purpoſely avoided; becauſe they would have naked truth prevail by its own force and by the power of God; and not by thoſe ornaments and dreſſings, which had been ſo often imployed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend falſhood to the World. Setting this aſide, there was no compariſon between the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, and that which had been formerly publiſhed. They comprehended in a few plain and ſimple words, more than all that could be found here and there ſcattered in the vaſt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of the Philoſophers. Nay, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the ſence of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> They called Men to the nobleſt degree of purity. For they cleanſed and ſcowred them from all filthineſs, not only of the fleſh, but alſo of the ſpirit. They advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the buſineſs of holy living to ſuch a pitch, that ſome ſaid it was impoſſible
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:204181:260"/>to be ſo good. And what did they do now? How did they overcome this objection? This is the greateſt marvel of all, and gave their teſtimony a mighty force: they ſhow'd by their own example that it was poſſible. This, ſays <hi>Lactantius,</hi> made the Philoſophers miſcarry in their deſign, that though they ſpake well, yet they did not live as they taught. <hi>For men had rather have examples than words:</hi> Becauſe it is eaſie to talk, and hard to do. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our therefore and his Apoſtles convinced men by their actions; that <hi>if they would not follow one that taught them, they might follow one that went before them.</hi> They guided them by their feet and not only by their tongues; they led their hearers the way, in all manner of vertuous and godly living. Nay, they refuſed ſometimes, to do thoſe things which they might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that all men might ſee their upright meaning, and that they had no worldly deſign in their head. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that whereas he might have lived upon the Goſpel and expected main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from them; yet he choſe to preach freely, and <hi>make the Goſpel without charge,</hi> that it might have an eaſier paſſage into their hearts, 1 Cor. ix. 12.18. And thus he did at <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> alſo, where he <hi>wrought
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:204181:261"/>with labour and travel Night and Day, that he might not be chargeable to any of them: Not becauſe he had not power</hi> to do otherwiſe, <hi>but to make himſelf an example unto them to follow him,</hi> 2 Theſſ. iii. 8, 9. And ſuch was his practice, you heard before, at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> xx. <hi>Act.</hi> 34. So that one would think he had taken up this generous reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, at the very firſt, which he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued every where, not to make the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt advantage by the Goſpel of which he was a Miniſter. It might have been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, one would think that he laboured in the Goſpel, and took pains to convert ſouls: He needed not have laboured alſo for his living, but expected food from thoſe whom he fed with the bread of life. But to make his Miniſtry unexceptionable, and to ſhow he intended nothing in the World, but to bring men to this belief in Jeſus; he would not ſo much as ſupport himſelf by their contributions, but by the labour of his own hands provided both for himſelf and for others too, as he tells the <hi>Epheſian</hi> El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who were inſtruments with him of their Salvation. Can there be any ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſincerity of ſuch a Man as this? What could he have in his mind but this one thing, to win Diſciples to his Maſter? And could he doubt, think you, of his
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:204181:261"/>power to reward him for all his labour? He was no fool it is plain, but underſtood himſelf as well as the wiſeſt of us all. What ſhould make him then neglect all other intereſts, and bend his mind wholly to ſerve <hi>Jeſus?</hi> Such noble ſpirits as his were the unlikelieſt of all other to cheat and deceive, whoſe only buſineſs it was to take pains, that they might give to others. And men of ſuch wiſdom would not have taken all that pains, for no other end, but merely to perſwade others to believe in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> if they had not been as ſure that he was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> as it was that they ſhould get nothing by preaching it, but ſtripes, impriſonments, infamy, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and perhaps loſe their lives to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And what ſhould make men ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of their bloud think you?</p>
                     <p n="2">II. That's now fit to be conſidered in the next place; their ſharp ſufferings, the BLOUD whereby our Saviour CAME, (that is, was proved to be the <hi>Chriſt</hi>) when he was preached by their Miniſtery. No ſooner did they appear, but all the world with its whole power armed it ſelf againſt them. As the <hi>Jews</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion oppoſed and perſecuted them; ſo when they fled into other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:204181:262"/>the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> upon the ſame ſcore, ſet their wits againſt them, and ſummoned all their Learning and their Arts of reaſoning to diſpute this new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine out of doors. To whoſe aſſiſtance came the <hi>Sophiſters</hi> and <hi>Rhetoricians,</hi> who imployed all their quirks and their elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to make it ſeem ridiculous. Nor did the <hi>Magicians</hi> and Juglers, with all the <hi>Daemons,</hi> the then Lords of the world, forget to oppoſe it with all their might. But excited Kings, and Preſidents, and Magiſtrates to exerciſe all kind of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not only againſt the preachers of this Religion, but againſt their followers. The Edicts of Princes thundred out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but confiſcations, proſcriptions, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, impriſonments, rods, axes, ſtrapadoes, croſſes, fire, wild-Beaſts: ſo that we may ſay of them all, as it was ſaid of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who were <hi>men that hazarded their lives for the name of the Lord</hi> Jeſus, xv. <hi>Acts.</hi> 26. Men <hi>ſet forth, appointed unto death</hi> (as thoſe that fought with wild-Beaſts) <hi>and made a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle unto the World, and to Angels and Men,</hi> 1 Cor. iv. 9. <hi>Even unto this preſent hour</hi> (ſays S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the following verſes) <hi>we both hunger and thirſt, and are naked, and are buffetted, and have no certain dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:204181:262"/>place; and labour working with our own hands: being reviled we bleſs: being perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, we ſuffer it: being defamed, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat</hi> (God for them:) <hi>we are made as the filth of the World, and are the off-ſcouring of all things unto this day.</hi> And as they were long thus vilely uſed and deſtined to death, ſo at laſt every one of them, together with other great ſervants of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuffered death in juſtification of this truth, that he was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> S. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> led the way, who is called the <hi>Martyr of Jeſus,</hi> having ſhed his <hi>Bloud</hi> for him, xxii. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. And he that calls him ſo, proteſts that he was <hi>ready not only to be bound, but alſo to die at Jeruſalem for his name,</hi> xxi. 13. Nay, when he ſpeaks of the Martyrdom of S. <hi>Steven,</hi> he was in the hands of his enraged enemies, who were ready to ſtone him too, and began to prepare themſelves for it, as you may read there xxii. 23. And both before and after this he was perſecuted with ſuch violent and bitter zeal, that his whole life was a kind of death, which he ſuffered over and over again for his Maſters cauſe. Which makes him ſay, when he gives a large ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of his ſufferings, that he was <hi>in deaths often,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 23, 25. and proteſt, in another place, that <hi>he died daily,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                        <pb n="500" facs="tcp:204181:263"/>xv. 31. and in another, that he was <hi>alway delivered unto death for Jeſus's ſake,</hi> and that <hi>death wrought in him,</hi> that he might make others live, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 11, 12. More than this you find in xvii. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5, 6. that the mother of harlots, that one City <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> was even <hi>drunk with the BLOUD of the Saints, and with the BLOUD of the MARTYRS of Jeſus.</hi> A Sea of BLOUD flowed from their veins, to cover the Earth with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord; for whoſe cauſe they ſuffered themſelves to be ſlain, as ſo many inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſheep that make no reſiſtance. This gave them the name of MARTYRS, in Engliſh WITNESSES, becauſe <hi>they were beheaded for the WITNESS of Jeſus, and for the Word of God,</hi> xx. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. that is, they conſtantly affirmed him to be the LORD, and choſe rather to die and ſeal it with their BLOUD, than not preach this Truth; for which S. <hi>John</hi> alſo was now an Exile in a deſolate place, 1 <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>What was it, think you, that made them thus hot and eager to be the moſt miſerable of all mankind? to deſpoil themſelves of all the comforts of life, and to endure perpetually the pains of death?
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:204181:263"/>From what cauſe was it, that their bloud thus boiled in their veins, and they were ſo zealouſly forward to have it let out?

No, when it came to that, they would have confeſt the truth ſure, if they had not preached it before. A few of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would have taught them more wit than <hi>to loſe their heads for the teſtimony of

The ſcoffs of the Heathen would have been very reaſonable, if they had not dealt ſincerely, and been certain their Teſtimony was the Truth. Who were wont to ſay, as we read in <hi>Minutius, Nec reſurgitis miſeri, nec interim vivitis,</hi> Miſerable wretches! you do but fancy you ſhall riſe again, and in the mean time you do not live. You are hungry, and pale, and enjoy none of the pleaſures of life; and have no hope of being better you are dead. To which, he replies, after a long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the evidence they had of what they believed, <hi>Ita beati reſurgimus, &amp; futuri contemplatione jam vivimus,</hi> So you ſee we ſhall riſe again to bleſſedneſs, and we live now in the bliſsful contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Yea, they not only <hi>lived,</hi> but they <hi>rejoyced:</hi> and more than that, they <hi>gloried</hi> in tribulations. Which they could not have done, had not their integrity been as great as this confidence, and their ſincere intentions upheld and ſupported their boldneſs. Which was the greater, you may be ſure, becauſe as they bare <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſo <hi>God bare WITNESS to them,</hi> as you read expreſly, ii. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.

Hitherto I have only proved that they had all things neceſſary to make them <hi>credible witneſſes,</hi> being void of guile, and ſuch as could not be reaſonably ſuppoſed to be mere inventors of what they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Men who both knew what they ſaid, and did not ſpeak contrary to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Nay, men of eminent knowledge, ſanctity and zeal, which made them more than <hi>common witneſſes.</hi> But ſtill they were only <hi>humane</hi> Witneſſes, not <hi>divine:</hi> nor could all this put it quite out of doubt, and give a full aſſurance, that what they ſaid was true; but only that they thought it to be true, and were not likely to be deceived. And therefore that they and thoſe who heard their teſtimony, might be ſure, and have infallible proofs (as S. <hi>Lukes</hi> words are) that they were
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:204181:265"/>not deceived; and that the faith which relied upon their teſtimony might be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine: there followed the <hi>Witneſs of the SPIRIT,</hi> which accompanied them, as it had done our Saviour; together with the Witneſs of the HOLY GHOST, which he had promiſed to ſend them, that they might be his <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in all the world. This was an undoubted evidence that they were men ſent of God upon this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, to preach <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and teſtifie that he was the Lord of all. This made the faith of thoſe who heard and believed them, to be more than an humane perſwaſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it relied not only on the word of men, but upon the teſtimony of the Spirit of God. It might have been a very ſtrong faith without this, becauſe the men who reported it were perſons of great vertue, void of all fraud, or worldly deſign: but it could not have been Divine, had not this Witneſs come and joyned its teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with theirs. For they would but have received the teſtimony of very pious and good men: it was no more, till the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God himſelf came, in ſuch ſigns, wonders, miracles and various gifts, as you have heard already, and as you read of in many other places. <hi>They went forth</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Mark,</hi> ſpeaking of all the
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:204181:265"/>Apoſtles) <hi>and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the Word</hi> (which they preached) <hi>with ſigns following,</hi> xvi. 20. All places were filled with wonder, as they were with the HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY GHOST. At <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, S. <hi>Steven</hi> as well as the Apoſtles, <hi>full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people,</hi> vi. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. In <hi>Samaria</hi> S. <hi>Philip</hi> preached Chriſt, <hi>and the people with one accord gave heed to the things which he ſpake, hearing and ſeeing the miracles which he did; for unclean Spirits crying with a loud voice, came out of many that were poſſeſſed with them, and many ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with palſies, and that were lame were healed,</hi> viii. 6, 7. And at <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells them that <hi>his Goſpel came not in word only, but alſo in power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance.</hi> And at <hi>Iconium</hi> both he and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſtai'd a long time, <hi>ſpeaking boldly in the Lord, who gave teſtimony unto the Word of his grace, and granted ſigns and wonders to be done by their hands,</hi> xiv. 3. And in the ſame manner, at <hi>Corinth, Coloſſe, Philippi,</hi> and all other places, the Divine power <hi>wrought in them mightily,</hi> i. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 29. upon which account they call themſelves, with great reaſon, <hi>Witneſſes OF GOD,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv.

Now that they did not take upon them to be <hi>Gods Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> when they had received no authority from him, nor were guilty of belying God (as the phraſe <gap reason="foreign">

Which made the Angel ſay, when S. <hi>John</hi> was going to worſhip him, by no means, ſee thou do it not: I am but thy fellow ſervant, one of thy Brethren that <hi>bears witneſs</hi> to <hi>Jeſus</hi> as thou doſt: <hi>For the teſtimony of Jeſus is the ſpirit of prophecy,</hi> xix. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. that is, thoſe gifts which the Apoſtles were endued withal, ſhowed whoſe miniſters they were, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſervants of the moſt High God, as well as the Angels, they owed no ſuch reſpect to them as S. <hi>John</hi> was about to give: and by thoſe Divine gifts they gave a <hi>teſtimony</hi> to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and proved he was the
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:204181:266"/>Son of God; wherein they were equal to the Angels, who could no more than te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie to him, and be his miniſters to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the glory wherein he was. Upon which errand not only this, but many other Angels appeared to S. <hi>John,</hi> who, together with the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>bare record of the Word of God,</hi> as I have noted before, <hi>and of the teſtimony of Jeſus, and of all things that he ſaw,</hi> i. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were <hi>labourers together with God,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 9.) who teſtified the ſame, and <hi>wrought as effectually</hi> in S. <hi>Peter</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as he was <hi>mighty in S.</hi> Paul <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Gentiles,</hi> ii. <hi>Gal.</hi> 8. For <hi>God wrought ſpecial miracles by his hands,</hi> xix. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. <hi>and made the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, through mighty ſigns and wonders, by the power of the SPIRIT of God,</hi> xv. <hi>Rom.</hi> 18, 19. So that the Faith of that Age, it is plain, <hi>did not stand in the wiſdom of men</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 5.) <hi>but in the power of God.</hi> They that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ſaw evidently that God was with the Apoſtles: nay, they felt, many of them, the power of God in themſelves, as you have heard before; when the Apoſtles communicated this vertue to others, which they had received from <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt. Which was ſuch a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:204181:267"/>him, as no counterfeit or falſe witneſs could ever imitate.</p>
                     <p>For it hath been a conſtant obſervation, that they who by Magick aſtoniſhed the People by wonderful feats, not only did them for their own gain and reputation, rather than for any benefit to the World; but alſo kept this ſecret to themſelves, and would not communicate their power to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. That would have ſpoiled their trade, and made them leſs admired, or at leaſt, leſs rich than they deſigned. But our Lord, on the contrary, had promiſed his Diſciples, that what he did when he was in the world, they ſhould do alſo, after he was gone. Nay, more than that, he tells them, <hi>Greater things ſhall ye do.</hi> And which is ſtill more, he promiſes that not only they, but others alſo ſhould do thoſe works, if they believed on him. xiv. Joh. 11, 12. <hi>Believe me for the very works ſake. Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do, ſhall he do alſo, and greater works than theſe ſhall he do; becauſe I go to my Father.</hi> Now thus it came to paſs, as our Saviour foretold. Not only the Apoſtles, but others alſo who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved through their word, received the Holy Ghoſt. For as S. <hi>Peter</hi> confidently
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:204181:267"/>invited his Crucifiers, to come and repent of what they had done, and be baptized <hi>every one of them</hi> in his Name, and they ſhould <hi>receive the gift of the Holy Ghost,</hi> ii. <hi>Act.</hi> 38. So it proved, that they who gladly received his word, were baptized, (<hi>ver.</hi> 41.) <hi>and were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> iv. 31. This was the thing that amazed that famous Sorcerer <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> whom the <hi>Samaritans</hi> admired as <hi>the great power of God,</hi> till S. <hi>Philip</hi> came thither, and perſwaded even him, by the miracles and ſigns which he did, to believe in Jeſus, as a greater power of God than himſelf. But when the Apoſtles alſo came, and by laying on of their hands the Holy Ghoſt was given to ſeveral perſons; He plainly ſaw that he was no body, and would have given any Money for ſuch a power, as he had not the leaſt ſhadow of. viii. <hi>Act.</hi> 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But all that I ſhall ſay of this matter, ſhall be out of one of the ancient defenders of the Chriſtian cauſe: who thought he might challenge all the world to ſhow him any thing like that which our Saviour did; or give an account how it might be done, if he was not the Son of God moſt high. It is <hi>Arnobius</hi> I mean, who in his firſt Book
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:204181:268"/>againſt the Gentiles, having delivered in a Catalogue of our Saviour's miracles, and ſhown they could not be the effect of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick; at laſt concludes with this great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, the ſubſtance of which I ſhall briefly relate. All theſe wonders which I have ſummed up, though not as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them required, Jeſus not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himſelf; but, which is a greater miracle, gave many others power to do them in his Name. For he fore-ſeeing there would be indeavours to detract from the glory of his famous actions, that he might leave no ſuſpicion in the minds of thoſe that heard of him, as if he were a Sorcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, choſe out of that vaſt multitude of People that followed him with no ſmall admiration, certain Fiſhermen, poor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, and other Country People; who going through all Nations might, without any tricks, falſe colours, or invoking the aſſiſtance of Spirits, work all thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles over again, which they ſaid he had wrought himſelf. As <hi>He</hi> commanded De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils to come out with a word of his mouth; in the ſame manner did <hi>they</hi> lay their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon them, and they obeyed. As He did but put forth his hand and touch a Leper, or bid him be clean, and his fleſh was reſtored like a little Childs; in the
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:204181:268"/>ſame manner did <hi>they</hi> ſmooth the skins of ſuch loathſome perſons, and reſtore them to the welcome ſociety of their friends and neighbours. It would be too tedious to number all things particularly that they did; and which is more (I may add) gave power to other Chriſtians to do in their Maſter's Name. They ſtopt the progreſs of cruel eating Cancers; they cloſed up <hi>Ulcera oris immenſi,</hi> wide and very gaping Ulcers; they gave feet to the lame, eyes to the blind, and life to the dead. Nor was there any thing, that aſtoniſhed all beholders, done by him; which he did not ſubject to the power of theſe infants, theſe ruſticks, and gave them authority to do it. What ſay you now, O ye incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ye hard, ye obſtinate hearts? Did your <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf ever give any mortal man ſuch power? Did he ever ſo much as beſtow upon his High-Prieſt, upon the moſt ſacred of all his High-Prieſts, I will not ſay the power to raiſe a dead man, or make a blind man ſee; but ſo much as to make a wheal or a pimple ſink down and lye even with the skin, by ſpeaking a word; or cure a little cleft, which a looſe skin ſometimes makes in the fingers end, only by touching it, or bidding it be angry no longer? And was it an humane power then
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:204181:269"/>from which ſuch great things as I have told you of, proceeded? Sure it was ſacred, ſure it was Divine: or if you will admit any more ſuperlative expreſſion, it was more than Divine, more than Sacred. For when thou doſt that which thou art able to do, and which is proportionable to thy power and ſtrength, there is no ſuch reaſon that admiration ſhould cry out: thou didſt that which thou hadſt ſtrength to do, and which one might expect from ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But now to be able to transfer thy right and power to another, and to make a frail weak creature do that, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to thy might alone; this is the effect of a power which is above all, and which contains in it the cauſes of all things, and the natures of all faculties. Go then and fetch us <hi>Zoroaſtres,</hi> that great Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian you brag of, through the torrid zone; or go and bring hither the Armenian that <hi>Cteſias</hi> writ of; nay ſummon <hi>Apollonius, Damigero, Dardanus,</hi> and all the reſt of your moſt eminent wonder-workers that ever were; let them be gathered together and joyn their forces, and let us ſee them give but one of the common people power to command by a plain word, a dumb man to ſpeak, or a man whoſe arms and leggs are withered to work and walk. Or if this
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:204181:269"/>be too difficult a thing, to make another do this, and do it with a ſimple command, let us ſee any of them do it themſelves. And let them call in the aſſiſtance of all their Daemons, let them gather all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical herbs which they can find in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Earth, and come with the whole power of their murmuring words, and with all their charms (we will except none of them, we forbid them nothing that they can get to aid them) and let them try, if with the help of all their gods to boot, they can do any ſuch thing as theſe poor ruſtick Chriſtians effected, <hi>nudis juſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus,</hi> by their naked and bare command. Ceaſe, O ye ignorant ſouls, therefore to ſcoff and to curſe when ye hear of theſe things: which cannot hurt him at all, but will bring no ſmall prejudice to your ſelves. For the Soul is a precious thing; nothing ought to be ſo dear to a Man as that: which is in hazard by blaſpheming Chriſt. Who is no ſuch contemptible perſon that you may laugh at him, but, as appears by theſe things, <hi>Deus ille ſublimis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That High God, God of God, God from unknown Kingdomes, God ſent by the most High to be the Saviour; whom neither the Sun him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor the brighteſt Stars, (if they have any ſenſe) nor the Principalities and Rulers
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:204181:270"/>of the World, no, nor your great Gods, or thoſe who feigning themſelves to be Gods terrifie all mankind with their formidable power, could ſo much as know or ſuſpect whence, or what he was, he is ſo great.</hi> But now that it is known, and he hath demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated it to the World by his Divine works; you had beſt ſubmit to him, and not imagine he is but one of us.</p>
                     <p>And that truly is good counſel for us all; to acknowledge Jeſus to be the Lord, and, ſubmitting our ſelves to his authority, to be governed by his Laws: which God from Heaven confirmed by the moſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous operations of the Spirit, and of the Holy Ghoſt. It is true we do not ſee and hear thoſe things, of which the Apoſtles and they that lived in their days were ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators and auditors: but we have the faithful records of thoſe miraculous works and of their Sermons left by themſelves. Regiſters were delivered under the unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable hands of thoſe divine men, of what they had ſeen and heard, and of what they themſelves ſaid and did. That is, the Teſtimony of the Apoſtles, and the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God was preſerved and kept in the Holy Books; which ſpake the ſame to the next Age, which their Fathers had
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:204181:270"/>ſeen with their eyes and heard with their ears in the Age foregoing. And moreover, for a further confirmation, that theſe were the lively Oracles of God (his word tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them, on which they might rely) they had a continuance of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt for ſome Ages follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the ſecond Age after our Saviour: And <hi>Origen, Minutius, Arnobius</hi> and <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> (to name no more in ſucceeding times) witneſs for the third and part of the fourth. How could they doubt of the truth of the reports which they had received, when they beheld them ſtill verified, as much as was neceſſary, in their own days; by the teſtimony of God himſelf? And as for the incredulous Gentiles who ſtopt their ears to theſe reports, they preſſed them very ſtrongly in this manner (to uſe the words that follow in <hi>Arnobius</hi>) as we may do thoſe who queſtion or disbelieve the Evangelical Hiſtory in our own Age. <q>Will you not believe good witneſſes of things that were done, unleſs you ſee them done your ſelves? Shall Authors of certain credit be rejected; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch things themſelves and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them to their poſterity to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived, with no ſmall approbation? You
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:204181:271"/>will ſay, who are thoſe? I anſwer, whole Countries, People, Nations, all that incredulous race of mankind, are our Witneſſes and the Authors we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. Who would never have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained theſe things, unleſs they had been clearer, as we ſay, than the light. Do you think that the men of that time were ſuch vain lying fools, ſuch ſots, ſuch brutes, that they feigned and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined they ſaw ſuch things as they never ſaw? and that they childiſhly affirmed ſuch things were done, when there was nothing like it? and when they might have lived with you in good eſteem, and contracted alliances and kindred among you, would chuſe to become the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hatred, and to make their very name execrable, without any reaſon for it? If this ſtory be falſe, whence comes all the world to be filled ſo ſoon with this Religion? Or how was it brought about that ſo many people, in ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Countries, and of ſuch different humours, ſhould all conſpire and agree together to believe it? Were they drawn away with mere words? And with the danger of their lives followed a poor deſpicable Preacher, when they ſaw nothing that was wonderful for
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:204181:271"/>ſtrange, to perſwade them to this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? What vain, ſenſeleſs imaginations are theſe? Therefore they believed, and ſuffered themſelves to be torn in pieces rather than deny it; becauſe they ſaw all theſe things done by him, and by his Preachers: who were ſent through the whole world to carry the benefits of our Father to mankind, and to beſtow the gifts of healing both on their Souls and Bodies.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>But our Writers have not ſet theſe things down faithfully. They have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled ſmall matters, and ambitiouſly magnified them beyond their juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Why ſo, I beſeech you? By what reaſon ſhall we believe any of your writings, if this Hiſtory of ours muſt be rejected? In which but a few things, of the many that were done, are record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by men of truth and honeſty. Did any God come down from Heaven, and write with his own hand, the ſtories that you believe? Or is there any thing of that nature writ againſt ours? Then you believe men, and ſo do we. Your Books were writ by men, and ſo were ours. And whatſoever you will ſay of
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:204181:272"/>ours, look for the ſame to be retorted upon your own. Will you have all things contained in your writings to be true? ſo are all contained in ours. Do you ſay ours are falſe? the ſame we ſay of yours. And how will you help your ſelves? You cannot ſay that you ſaw the things that you believe, no more than we: But others ſaw them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you believe them, and ſo do we. But ours were writ by rude and unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, and therefore not to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Conſider if this be not an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to our cauſe, and a ſtronger reaſon to conclude that theſe writings are ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no lies, but delivered with a ſimple mind, ignorant how to amplifie things, and ſo ſet them off with deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dreſſes.</q> As for that which follows concerning the trivial ſordid ſtile, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſaid the Apoſtles writ, it does not in the leaſt render the faithfulneſs of their relations ſuſpected: and therefore I paſs it over and omit his reply to it; though I cannot well neglect this pertinent obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his Preface to his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe upon S. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel. <q>The lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſays he, of the Goſpel is ſo ſimple and rude, that if any body compare it with the Hiſtory of <hi>Thucydides</hi> or <hi>Livy,</hi>
                           <pb n="519" facs="tcp:204181:272"/>he will want abundance of things, and be offended at as many. How many things do the Evangeliſts paſs by? How many do they but juſt touch in two or three words? In how many places do they diſagree in the order of their Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in how many others do they ſeem to thwart one another? Theſe things might make a Reader leſs like them, and not give ſuch credit to what he reads. For on the contrary, they that wrote humane Hiſtories, how ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous were they about their entrance upon their work? How ſcrupulouſly did they weigh their words? What care did they imploy to obſerve a decent order, to ſet down nothing but what was plauſible and exactly deſcribed? And with what art do they endeavour to ſet things lively before our eyes? With what pleaſures do they intice and detain the minds of the Readers, that they may not at all grow weary of them? And yet theſe elaborate Monuments, for the greateſt part, are loſt; and thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main are not read with any aſſurance that they report nothing but the truth. For who is ſo credulous, as to believe that <hi>Titus Livius</hi> tells never a tale in his Hiſtory? But there are millions of men
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:204181:273"/>found, who had rather die ten times, than think there is one ſentence falſe in the Evangelical ſtory? Is it not plain by this, that it is not a buſineſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power and prudence, but conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Divine vertue? What Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher is there that ever had the confidence to propound ſuch Paradoxes as theſe, with hope to be believed? That one <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> was crucified, and by his death ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mankind; that he was God and Man, born of a Virgin; that he roſe again from the dead, and ſits at the right hand of God the Father; that he taught, they were bleſſed men who mourned, hungred and thirſted, were afflicted, ill-ſpoken of, and killed for the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his name; and that one day they ſhould live again, and ſee him ſit in judgment to give immortality to the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and endleſs pains to the ungodly. What is there plauſible and taking in all this? And yet the humble low ſtile of the Goſpel perſwaded men of this, ſo that thouſands, millions, will rather forſake their lives than this plain truth; which a few private, unknown, poor, mean diſciples of his delivered to the World.</q>

What do we ſee now, more than our Forefathers did in <hi>Arnobius</hi> his days, or thoſe which ſucceeded, that gives us any cauſe to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their truth? Are they altered from what they were? If any company of men had been ſo bold as to venture at ſuch a change, they would firſt have mended the ſtile no doubt, and placed things in greater order and method, according to the exacteſt rules of art. But that they are untained an uncorrupted, and, in no material paſſage, vary from what they were in former Ages, appears by what all Chriſtian Writers have tranſcribed out of them into their Books, which agrees with that which we now read. They are the ſame now that ever they were. They contain a relation of thoſe things, which converted, as <hi>Arnobius</hi> ſays, the incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous world: who did not want wit nor learning no more than we; but ſaw great reaſon to renounce all the fables which had been told of their Gods, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what they read here concerning <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>

And therefore there is no reaſon that our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould loſe his authority among us, becauſe the Apoſtles his WITNESSES have left the world, and ſo has the WITNESS of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> ſince that which they teſtified to mankind ſtands upon authentick record, in the holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which cannot with any ſhow of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be queſtioned: For if we do not allow this way of conveying down a teſtimony to future times, we can know nothing of what was done before us. And by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all credit to theſe writings, we ſhall only teach poſterity how little credit is
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:204181:274"/>due to any of ours. Nay, we ſhall ſhake all mens titles to their eſtates: and Kings will not be able to keep their Crowns faſt upon their heads. Nothing will be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but it may be queſtioned whether all the Records in the Tower, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Acts of former Kings and Parliaments be not mere Forgeries.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, no body in thoſe days ever went about to diſprove what theſe <hi>Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Chriſt</hi> preached and have writ. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Gentile</hi> undertook to ſhow that theſe things were only deviſed for his credit. There were too great Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from Heaven ſtill remaining in the Church for ſeveral Ages, to confute ſuch a ſlander. And therefore all that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himſelf could think of to ſhake mens belief, was to ſet up ſome wonder-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his own, to confront <hi>Jeſus:</hi> and as it were to vie miracles with him and his Diſciples. But all were ſo ſoon ſcattered, like miſts before the Sun, that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be but thin ſhadows in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the living SPIRIT of God, that was in the Church, which baffled and overcame them all. Inſomuch that <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> aſſures the Heathen, and they never went about to confute him, that there
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:204181:275"/>were not above <hi>thirty</hi> of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his followers then to be found in the world; though he had made diligent enquiry after them, by travel into all parts. They were all vaniſhed, though he made a great noiſe for a time, whileſt the followers of <hi>Jeſus</hi> multiplied and increaſed, even by their perſecutions. Nor could <hi>Apollonius</hi> afterward gain any Proſelytes, that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued; but his fame ſoon died together with himſelf. Whereas the authority of <hi>Jeſus</hi> bare up it ſelf againſt all the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and not only was ſupported, but advanced, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed more and more: their barbarous cruelties only making it grow the faſter. For herein, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> obſerves, the faith and conſtancy of Chriſtians was bravely diſplayed. Men thought they did not without cauſe abhor the Heatheniſh ſuperſtition, when they ſaw them rather die than do that, which others doing, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and enjoyed the greateſt worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity. It made them enquire what that good was, which they defended even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death: which was dearer than all the pleaſures and glory of this world. The people heard them in the midſt of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, glory in Chriſt <hi>Jeſus.</hi> And whileſt they enquired who he was, the
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:204181:275"/>truth of the Goſpel was divulged and ſpread abroad among them. Their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings brought many to ſee their Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and there they ſaw that which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their enquiry; and by their enquiry they were ſatisfied, and learnt to believe in <hi>Jeſus</hi> as thoſe <hi>Martyrs</hi> did.</p>
                     <p>But it is time to put an end to this Chapter, which I ſhall conclude with a few remarks upon ſome places of the holy Books, relating to the teſtimony of the Apoſtles, or thoſe that followed them. The firſt is in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. where you read how the Apoſtles <hi>approved themſelves as the miniſters of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in neceſſities, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streſſes, in stripes, in impriſonments, in tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, in labours, in watchings, in faſtings, by pureneſs, by knowledge, by long-ſuffering, by kindneſs, by the Holy Ghoſt, by love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, by the word of truth,</hi> &amp;c. In which words, if they be well conſidered, you will find every one of theſe three WITNESSES, which S. <hi>John</hi> ſays, gave teſtimony to our Saviour on Earth: ſo that he might be ſaid to <hi>come</hi> in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Apoſtles, <hi>by Water, and Bloud, and the Spirit.</hi> They expreſſed the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his life, <hi>by their pureneſs, by their
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:204181:276"/>long-ſuffering, by their kindneſs, by love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, by the armour of righteouſneſs on the right hand and on the left;</hi> that is, they were every way appointed and armed with integrity againſt all calumnies; there was none that could touch their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and ſay that theſe men had any worldly deſign. And as they witneſſed to him thus in their holy lives, ſo they did in their holy doctrine, <hi>by knowledge, and by the word of truth,</hi> preaching the Goſpel ſincerely, as thoſe that ſtudied not to pleaſe men, but God who trieth the hearts. And they were made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable alſo to his death, and thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the witneſs of the BLOUD, <hi>in much patience, in afflictions, in neceſſities, in diſtreſſes, in impriſonments,</hi> and all the reſt of the hardſhips here mentioned, which I need not tranſcribe again. And laſtly, He forgets not to remember them of the Witneſs of the SPIRIT which they brought along with them: For he ſays they approved themſelves as miniſters of God, <hi>by the Holy Ghoſt, and by the power of God.</hi> That is, beſide all the other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine gifts wherewith they appeared, they confirmed their doctrine by many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous works, which could not be done but by the power of God. Thus they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:204181:276"/>not only <hi>his witneſſes,</hi> as our Saviour ſaid they ſhould, xxiv. <hi>Luke</hi> 48. but they witneſſed to him after the very ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he had taught in his example; by <hi>Water,</hi> by <hi>Bloud,</hi> and by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And therefore when he exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to preach the Goſpel, and to be ſtrong in the grace of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt, and to commit the charge of preaching alſo to other faithful perſons, He enforces his perſwaſion by this argument; that the things he was to deliver were only ſuch as <hi>he had heard of him among or by MANY WITNESSES,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 2. He learnt them by ſo many good evidences which S. <hi>Paul</hi> had given him, that he need not fear to ſpeak them to any man, much leſs doubt to commend them to other faithful preachers (upon the ſame account that he had received them) that they might be able to inſtruct poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                     <p>Such, one would think from what hath been ſaid, were thoſe <hi>TWO WITNESSES</hi> mentioned in xi. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. men of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical ſpirit, whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> raiſed up, after his prime <hi>Witneſſes</hi> had left the world, to juſtifie ſtill by all manner of arguments that great Truth, which they had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſealed with their Bloud, and God
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:204181:277"/>had ſealed by the teſtimony of the Spirit. The next words indeed ſeem to import that the whole body of Chriſtians, whom they inſtructed, joyned with them in this teſtimony: But ſtill theſe great miniſters of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt, the guides and leaders of thoſe Chriſtians (whoſoever they were, and in what times ſoever they lived, I meddle not with ſuch difficulties) were his moſt eminent <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> Who preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel with ſuch power, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited againſt them the fury of unbelievers, who could not endure that ſuch <hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſhould ſpeak for <hi>Jeſus.</hi> For they teſtified to him theſe <hi>three</hi> ways here mentioned (which is all that I alledge this place for, not taking upon me to interpoſe in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies there are about the explanation of this Viſion) by Water, Bloud and the Spirit. Firſt by <hi>Water,</hi> if we underſtand thereby, their holy preaching and living. For it is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. that they had power <hi>to propheſie:</hi> which ſignifies that they were endowed with extraordinary gifts (for <hi>Prophets</hi> were next to <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the Church) to interpret and expound the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writings; and prove out of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets (as our Saviour did, xxiv. <hi>Luke</hi> 27.) all things that concerned him, both his ſufferings and his glory. And
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:204181:277"/>this they did <hi>cloathed in ſackcloth;</hi> that is, in the habit of <hi>mourners:</hi> for the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I ſuppoſe, which they ſaw commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the provoking infidelity of thoſe to whom they preached. Which was a notable mark of their great piety and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as you may learn from ix. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. and v. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. They are ſaid alſo to be <hi>the two Olive-trees, ver.</hi> 4. that is, like <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> (two famous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons among the <hi>Jews</hi> after the captivity, who were repreſented by this Emblem, iv. <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.) <hi>King and Prieſts unto God;</hi> men endowed with great authority and illumination from above, and with as great purity. For they had ſo much of the oil of gladneſs, that they imparted it to others: <hi>to the Candleſticks;</hi> that is, the Churches wherein they ſhined. For ſo S. <hi>John</hi> teaches us, in the beginning of this Book, to interpret <hi>Candleſticks:</hi> which is a great argument of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of theſe men, who by the witneſs of their life and doctrine, made all thoſe who were under their care, to teſtifie, ſome way or other, to the ſame truth that they did. At leaſt by their lives; for they are ſaid <hi>to stand before the God of the Earth.</hi> Which is an <hi>Hebrew</hi> phraſe, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying to miniſter unto God, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:204181:278"/>in his worſhip and ſervice, as the Prieſts and People were at the Temple: and therefore ſets forth the piety and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe perſons, whoſe buſineſs it was to ſerve God, even then when it was moſt dangerous ſo to do.</p>
                     <p>And as by Water, ſo by <hi>Bloud</hi> alſo they bare witneſs of him. For they had <hi>war made againſt them,</hi> and in the fight, ſince they would not yield, they were <hi>killed, ver.</hi> 7. Nay, it was notorious to all, that their perſecutors had not only drawn the ſword againſt them, but that they had reſiſted <hi>unto bloud:</hi> for <hi>their dead bodies lay in the street of the great City, ver.</hi> 8. and they would <hi>not ſuffer them to be put in graves, ver.</hi> 9. which ſhows the enraged malice which they bare to theſe zealous WITNESSES: who had <hi>tormented them</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 10.) by the ſharpneſs of their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by their conſtant reproofs of their infidelity and wickedneſs.</p>
                     <p>Nor was the <hi>Witneſs of the SPIRIT</hi> wanting: for they approved themſelves as Miniſters of God, to ſpeak in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s language, and Witneſſes of Chriſt by wonders and miracles ſo great, that they might be compared to the two great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:204181:278"/>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who appeared with our Saviour on the holy Mount. For they ſent <hi>fire out of their mouths</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 5.) and had <hi>power to ſhut up Heaven that it ſhould not rain,</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 6.) both which were the known works of <hi>Elias.</hi> They had <hi>power likewiſe over the Waters, to turn them to bloud, and to ſmite the Earth with all plagues, as often as they pleaſed, ver.</hi> 6. which is the plain deſcription of men like to <hi>Moſes:</hi> who brought ſuch plagues on the <hi>Egyptians</hi> as theſe had power to do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who were like them; both in hardneſs of heart and in oppreſſion of the faithful ſervants of God. And therefore I ſuppoſe they are deſcribed with a power to hurt and deſtroy, rather than with that healing and ſaving vertue wherewith the <hi>firſt Witneſſes</hi> of Chriſt principally came, to ſignifie that their rebellious enemies ſhould be puniſhed for their rejecting <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and doing <hi>deſpight to the SPIRIT of grace:</hi> which once came to them in a more healthful and ſalutary manner, caſting out Devils, turning Water into Wine, healing all manner of Plagues and Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and that as often as they themſelves pleaſed to deſire. And more than this you read (<hi>ver.</hi> 11.) that after the time appointed by God for it, he reſtored theſe
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:204181:279"/>
                        <hi>Prophets</hi> to life again: and thereby made their teſtimony ſomething like that of his Son's. That is, men animated with the very ſame ſpirit ſtood up in their place, to the amazement of all their oppoſers. Who were ſo far from being able to hurt them, that they were as ſafe as if they had been <hi>in Heaven.</hi> The preſence of God was with them, as in <hi>the cloud</hi> which preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from all danger: And he advanced them to great honour, by the Heavenly gifts wherewith they were adorned. As <hi>Elias</hi> is ſaid to come though he did not appear in perſon, but another in his ſpirit and power; and <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to be raiſed up to reign over the <hi>Jews</hi> (xxx. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.) becauſe his Son, that is, Chriſt was ſet upon his Throne: ſo did <hi>the Spirit of life from God enter into theſe witneſſes, and they stood upon their feet,</hi> when he raiſed up other Apoſtolical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their ſtead, who were not leſs emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent than thoſe who were dead, but full of the ſame ſpirit of wiſdom, holineſs, burning zeal, and might and power alſo from God. This frighted all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as well it might, when they ſaw the Chriſtian Cauſe would not die, do what they could. But if they killed ſome, others ſtarted up in their room to witneſs
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:204181:279"/>unto <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and aſſert the ſame truth; by wonders, by their admirable preaching, by their holy life, and by death it ſelf; if nothing elſe would ſatisfie them.</p>
                     <p>For thus all the MARTYRS teſtified to him. Whoſe <hi>BLOUD</hi> witneſſed not only that they believed his Religion, and that they valued the favour of <hi>Jeſus</hi> more than their lives; but that they had very good reaſon ſo to do: or elſe men of ſuch wiſdom would not have endured ſuch tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as they freely expoſed themſelves unto, with ſo much chearfulneſs, as we find they did. For as S. <hi>Hilary</hi> tells us, <hi>Some gloried in the chains which they wore in priſon; others being beaten till they died, did nothing but give thanks; others readily laid down their necks to be cut off: and more ran to thoſe piles, which they ſaw built to burn them; and, with a devout haſte, leapt into thoſe fires, at which the miniſters of their torments trembled; and there were thoſe who were thrown into the Sea, not as if they were to be drown'd, but went to partake of the refreſhment of eternal bliſs.</hi> So he writes upon thoſe words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> lxv. 10, 12. <hi>Thou haſt tried us, as ſilver is tried: we went through fire and water,</hi> &amp;c. The fruit of which was, that thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:204181:280"/>were converted unto Chriſt. Their death gave life to others, who ſeeing their zeal, their conſtancy, their meekneſs, their patience, and their charity, became Proſelytes to that faith for which they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. A new race of illuſtrious <hi>Martyrs</hi> roſe up in their ſtead, in whom they yet lived. For <hi>there was no other cauſe</hi> (as that Father adds upon the following Verſe) why they gave themſelves as whole burnt offerings to Chriſt, <hi>but that by the example of their Faith and Martyrdom, they might inſtruct many more to be Martyrs.</hi> Nay, their BLOUD did not only water many young plants, and made them grow to their perfection; but He tells us a little after, in his expoſition of the ſame <hi>Pſalm, Plures ſcimus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We know many who were wholly ignorant of the Divine Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Chriſtian Religion) <hi>that by the example of the Martyrs run to Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> No wonder then, that theſe above all others have been called the WITNES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES of <hi>Jeſus</hi> (for that's the interpretation of the word MARTYR) and that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were forward even to kiſs their wounds, and to embrace their dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as the remains of thoſe who had done moſt eminent ſervice to our Lord. Who himſelf therefore witneſſed to <hi>them</hi>
                        <pb n="535" facs="tcp:204181:280"/>after they were dead, and declared that their <hi>bloud</hi> was very dear and precious in his ſight, and that it had ſealed nothing but the truth. For there can no other reaſon be given but this, why at the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of theſe MARTYRS or WIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESSES our Saviour was pleaſed to have ſo many miracles wrought afterward, and before ſuch a number of people, that <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry</hi> himſelf (as we learn both from S. <hi>Cyril</hi> and S. <hi>Hierom</hi>) though an avowed enemy of our Religion, could not but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them. They ſtill ſpake and bare <hi>Witneſs</hi> to <hi>Jeſus</hi> by theſe wonderful works, when they were dead; or rather <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpake for them, as I ſaid, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared from Heaven that theſe were his <hi>faithful Witneſſes,</hi> whoſe word ought to be believed, whereby they had declared him to be the Lord.</p>

<pb n="537" facs="tcp:204181:281"/>to endue his Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Teachers, with power from on high; that they might be his Witneſſes, and</hi> commit that which they had received to faithful men, who ſhould be able to teach others alſo. <hi>O God, I cannot but again adore thy incomprehenſible love, which can never be ſufficiently praiſed. Who can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the exceeding riches of thy grace, that thou whoſe naked glory is too bright for our weak minds to fix their eyes upon, wouldest be pleaſed in moſt admirable condeſcending love, to manifeſt thy ſelf and viſit us in our fleſh? Thou art infinitely above the greateſt of us; who are far leſs worthy to approach thee than the lowest creature in this world is fit for our friendſhip and ſociety. So much the more marvellous is thy unheard of love, that thou wouldest admit us to ſuch a near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto thee. So much the greater is our happineſs, that in Christ</hi> Jeſus <hi>thou hast made thy ſelf our portion, and deſigned us to be eternally bleſſed with thee. Great was his care and kindneſs all the days of his fleſh, towards the most miſerable wretches: who received the greatest tokens of his love. I rejoyce now to think with what tenderneſs he received the poor, fed the hungry, viſited the ſick, cured the diſeaſed; and when he had left the world, communicated the ſame power
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:204181:282"/>unto others, that they might exerciſe the ſame charity that he had done. I ſee both the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and goodneſs of our Lord, in all thoſe works of wonder which he did. I ſee that his mercy endureth for ever, which hath preſerved a faithful record of theſe things, that we</hi> through patience and comfort of the holy Scriptures might have hope.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Now the God of all grace inſpire me and all other Christian Souls, with the ſame faith, love and ardent zeal, which was in thoſe burning and ſhining Lights, the Witneſſes of Christ. That we may be followers of them, as they were of him: and acknowledging the ſame Lord, being members of the ſame body, partaking of the ſame Sacraments, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon the ſame Heavenly food; we may lead the ſame holy lives, in hope to ſhine one day with them in the ſame celestial glory. Help us to</hi> continue in the things which we have learnt, and have been aſſured of, knowing of whom we have learnt them; that we may not at any time let them ſlip. For how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us by them that heard him; thou, O God, alſo bearing them witneſs both with ſigns and wonders, and with divers
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:204181:282"/>miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to thine own will? <hi>May we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carefully lay up and preſerve theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred truths in our heart, which were in ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a manner delivered to us! May they work there perpetually with great power, and be reverenced as the holy Oracles of God! May they be the ſpring of all our motions, throughout the whole courſe of our life! That with an even steddy pace, whatſoever dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers come in our way, we may walk on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that happy place, where thoſe holy ones rejoyce for ever with our Lord. To whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by us, and by thoſe glorified Spirits, and by all the Angels in Heaven, everlasting Praiſes.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IT is time now to bring this Diſcourſe to an iſſue: and, having examined all theſe Divine <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> taken their proofs and depoſitions, and found their teſtimony, upon due enquiry, to be good and legal, to conſider with our ſelves what we have to do, and what judgment we will paſs now that we have heard their evidence. God the <hi>Father</hi> of all, ſays that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is his Son; the <hi>Word</hi> himſelf appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed oft to juſtifie this Truth; the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> came down from Heaven to atteſt it; the <hi>Prophet of the Highest</hi> proclaimed it; the <hi>holy life</hi> of our Saviour ſpake as much; and his <hi>Bloudy Death</hi> ſealed it; to which the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſet its ſeal alſo, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably witneſſed that bloud was ſacred which he ſhed, for a teſtimony, upon the
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:204181:284"/>Croſs. All theſe have done their part, all that <hi>Witneſſes</hi> by their office are to do, for the making of this good, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Son of God. That which remains is our task: who are bound to conſider, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ponder, and impartially judge, and then faithfully improve their ſacred Teſtimony, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> may have the <hi>glory</hi> that is due unto him, and we may have that <hi>benefit,</hi> which God by him deſigns to beſtow upon us.</p>
                     <div n="1" type="section">
                        <head>I.</head>
                        <p>And firſt of all let us conſider a-while the great weight and importance of this Truth, that <hi>Jeſus is Gods Son.</hi> If the whole frame of Chriſtian Religion did not rely upon it; there would not have been ſuch care taken to ſettle it, and lay it deep in our hearts, by ſo much labour and ſtrength of argument. It is equally blameable to be laborious about a trifle, and to be ſuperficial and ſlight in things of greateſt moment. No man of ſenſe will, with a great deal of diligence, ſummon together a number of Witneſſes, to make good that which, when it is proved, it is indifferent (as to any thing that depends upon it) whether it be true or falſe. No
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:204181:284"/>queſtion there is a conſiderable intereſt of ours, which is concerned in this truth; elſe the Holy men of God would not have called HEAVEN AND EARTH TO WITNESS and bear their teſtimony to it. The <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> would not have concurred with the <hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>Bloud</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> to aſſert and maintain it; but that all is little enough to juſtifie it, and that it is a thing of which we cannot but deſire the greateſt aſſurance. It is (1.) the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all other Truths in the Chriſtian Religion, as you may read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 11. xvi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17, 18. It is the <hi>Rock</hi> on which the Church is built; the Ground that ſupports the whole Fabrick: which if it be infirm and rotten, all falls to rubbiſh and confuſion. And therefore (2.) the Devil laboured to undermine this Truth above all others. Like a ſubtile E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, when the Apoſtles as <hi>wiſe Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>builders</hi> had laid this foundation, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed falſe Teachers and counterfeit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, as ſo many Pioneers, to work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, and lay their trains to blow it up: which he knew was a nearer way to ruine all, than to plant his Batteries againſt the building onely. The Hiſtory of the firſt times afford too plentiful inſtances of this. For we find there aroſe <hi>many Anti-christs,</hi>
                           <pb n="544" facs="tcp:204181:285"/>1 <hi>Joh.</hi> ii. 18. and <hi>many falſe Prophets</hi> went out into the World: iv. 1. And the very <hi>ſpirit of Antichriſt,</hi> as he tells us, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. was this, to deny that <hi>Jeſus, who came in fleſh</hi> (in a mortal condition and ſubject to our miſeries) <hi>was Christ.</hi> They would not have it thought that any one who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo vilely, was the great KING that had been ſo long expected. Or if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be a great Prophet, and that he was raiſed from the dead, and rewarded for his labours in Heaven, as other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were; yet they denied that he was made LORD OF ALL, the Head of the Church and of all Principalities and Powers; who was to be honoured by all Men, even as they honour the Father. And therefore (3.) the Apoſtles imployed as great care and earneſt indeavour for to ſtrengthen and ſupport this weighty truth, as the Enemies of Religion laboured might and main, as we ſay, to weaken and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the belief of it. This was the thing they every where preached, as you read in the Hiſtory of the Acts of the Apoſtles. And for this very end S. <hi>John</hi> wrote this Epiſtle, to confirm his Diſciples in this Faith, againſt all the ſubtile oppoſition of their adverſaries; as you may collect from many paſſages beſide that which I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:204181:285"/>And it was the thing aimed at alſo in his ſecond Epiſtle, where he rejoyces to hear that they <hi>walkt in the truth,</hi> verſ. 3. and cautions them againſt <hi>thoſe deceivers and Antichrists,</hi> verſ. 7. And indeed (4.) it was the great note of difference between the true Prophets and the falſe, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 3. and in the place now mentioned in this Epiſtle, iv. 1, 2. which alſo (5.) makes him command his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that if any one pretending to the Spirit did not acknowledge this; they ſhould not uſe the common civility to him, of bidding him <hi>God ſpeed,</hi> ii. Epiſt. 10. And if any man apoſtatiz'd from this faith (which is the laſt thing I ſhall mention) S. <hi>Paul</hi> pronounces a moſt dreadful curſe upon him, and wiſhes or predicts the Lord would come and ſpeedily execute it, 1 <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> xvi. 22. <hi>For whoſoever tranſgreſſeth and abideth not in the Doctrine of CHRIST, hath not God:</hi> 2. epiſt. of S. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.</p>
                        <p>This being a truth therefore of ſo great moment, as appears by theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by the many <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to which S. <hi>John</hi> here appeals for the proof of it; let us be ſure to ſettle a ſenſe of its concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us, in our hearts; and then to think often of it, and ſtudy it ſo thoroughly,
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:204181:286"/>that we may perceive both the truth and importance of it: or elſe we ſhall prove our ſelves deſpiſers of God, who do as bad as ſay, that it was a needleſs pains which he beſtowed, in giving ſo many evidences of that, for which we have no regard, or no liſt to bring to trial and examination. And that truly, I doubt, is the temper of moſt Chriſtian People at this day. They think all diſcourſes on this ſubject uſeleſs or little worth; becauſe they prove that which they believe already. Heathens might reap ſome profit by them, but what, ſay they, have we to do with them? But while ſuch thoughts as theſe have too long poſſeſſed the drowſie Chriſtian world, they remain, alas! in the very dregs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm, with a little ſmack or taſte of Chriſtianity. It is a ſad thing to conſider, but ſo it is, that they who cannot endure to think upon what ground their belief ſtands (becauſe they would not put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the trouble of underſtanding it) are of that baſe temper which is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Idolatry, of Mahometiſm, and of all ſpurious Religions in the World. For what is it makes Men worſhip the Sun, Moon and Stars, or addreſs their ſervices to dead men, nay to a piece of wood, or a red cloth, or ſome ſuch paultry thing? what
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:204181:286"/>makes <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſo reverenced, by a great part of the World, as the Prophet of the Higheſt; but that they have ever been ſo taught, and it is the cuſtome to honour him? They examine no further, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for any other reaſon; that is, do not obſerve that there is no other reaſon for their belief. Upon the very ſame account do many receive Jeſus for the Son of God; He hath no better footing in their Souls, nor ſtands upon firmer grounds, than <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> or the Sun, or an Idol does, in the opinion of other men. There is no other reaſon, as far as they know, but only the common practice of the place where they live, why they honour him as the great Lord who governs all. Is not this a foul diſhonour to our Saviour, to have no better ſubjects, nor a ſtronger hold, than this, of their hearts? How little is he beholden to thoſe, who can juſtifie his Title, upon no better principles, than others make uſe of in the behalf of the Uſurpers of Divinity? But it reflects the greateſt ſhame in our own faces, that we ſhould have ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and good evidence in our Books, and none at all in our minds. What is that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect worth which we pretend to Religion, if a falſe would have been accepted with as much affection as we have for the
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:204181:287"/>true; had it not come too late?</p>
                        <p>The People would have Chriſt's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to move their affections; to carry them away with a torrent of words, and earneſt expreſſions. But to what ſhall they carry them? ſtay a while and anſwer that queſtion. If it be not to that which is true, they will do you wrong to hurry them ſo violently and in ſuch haſte, to that from which you ought rather to run away. Now how ſhall you know whether it be to the Truth or no? Muſt it not be proved by good reaſons; muſt they not make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and clear that they propound ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which ought to be entertained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can ſafely move any mans heart to embrace it? But to what purpoſe is all this done, if after all their labour, you will not conſider it? If all this muſt be paſſed by as dry ſtuff, and you will gape only for the application? Conſider, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, that if the affections you deſire ſhould be ſtirred, be not grounded on good judgment (which muſt be ſetled on ſome weighty reaſon) they are ſo far from being ſo good as they ought; that they may ſoon prove very hurtful and bad. They diſpoſe a man to be an empty Enthuſiaſt; to be rapt away with any paſſionate, though idle,
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:204181:287"/>ſtory; and to be ſet on fire by zealous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions for any plauſible though dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous error. In ſhort, ſuch affections are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to be either good or bad, as it chances. Therefore if you would have our Lord <hi>commend you</hi> for being of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rather than of any other; if you would have the <hi>praiſe</hi> of it; ſtudy well ſuch things as theſe, which from the Holy wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings I have propounded to be conſidered in the foregoing Treatiſe: for you ſee the very bottom of his Religion ſtands upon them. So ſhall you be ſatisfied alſo that your affections are truly good, when you are moved with love towards him, becauſe you <hi>are ſure and know</hi> (as <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſpeaks, vi. Joh. 69.) <hi>that he is that CHRIST, the Son of the living God.</hi> Do you not think that many have a very tender melting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and that they are full of devotion to ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saints, and feel a great paſſion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in their Prayers to them, or in their commendation of them? Have a care, leſt your affections to the Lord Jeſus be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than theſe. How can you think that they are of an higher ſtrain, more than meer natural and imaginative things; if you have no better reaſons to prove that he is to be worſhipped, than they have to
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:204181:288"/>build their reſpect upon to thoſe? If you receive him for the <hi>King of Heaven,</hi> upon the ſame account that ſhe is ſet up for the <hi>Queen</hi> (becauſe it is the common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which you have ſuckt in with your Mothers milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) your love to him is juſt like their love to her: nothing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nor Heavenly, but a natural paſſion, which is as ready to ſpend it ſelf upon any other perſon, as on himſelf.</p>
                        <p>And here it will be fit to add, that we ought to be very cautious what we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; becauſe there are ſo many cheats in the world. And of thoſe above all others we ought to be well aware, who would have us uſe no caution; but greedily ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, without any chewing, that which they deliver to us upon their word. God you ſee would not have us believe without good reaſons; and reaſons proportionable to the weight of the thing, which we are to believe. His Miniſters appeal to the teſtimony of known <hi>Witneſſes:</hi> and where Witneſſes offer themſelves to us to prove any thing, it is our duty ſure to hear and examine them. And we ought not to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render our belief to any thing careleſly; nor, either out of idleneſs and ſloth, or being over awed by the confidence which
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:204181:288"/>any men aſſume to themſelves, content our ſelves with an implicite faith: neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to ſearch, and prove, and try all things, which demand to have no leſs than our Souls reſigned up unto them. For that which commands our underſtanding, and hath got authority there, hath a right to govern our Will and command the whole man. And therefore we had need take care what we ſuffer to ſeat it ſelf in that throne; for according as our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and judgments are, ſo will our incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations be, both in our affections and in our lives. It is a great commendation which <hi>Socrates</hi> gives <hi>Gebes,</hi> that he was careful to enquire into all things, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh them, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently believe that which any body ſaid, though otherwiſe he had ſufficient reſpect unto him. That warineſs which was in an Heathen ſure doth as much or more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us Chriſtians. Who ought to ſuſpect thoſe who would have us believe them, without putting our ſelves to the trouble of much ſearch. It is a ſign they mean to deceive; for if God himſelf doth not expect to be believed, unleſs there be good wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for that to which his Embaſſadors demand aſſent; why ſhould men be ſo
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:204181:289"/>preſumptuous as to ask us to believe them blindly? Or why ſhould we be ſuch obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient fools, as to do more for them than God would have us do for himſelf? He hath given us eyes, and therefore we ought to look about us, eſpecially when men bid us wink and take any thing upon truſt. He hath endued us with Reaſon, and therefore we ought to ſift and try, and examine that which is propounded to us. And if any body ſay, do not try nor exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; you are not able to diſcern the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of things; believe as we teach, for we cannot deceive you: mark that man or company of men, as the greateſt Deceivers. Who intend to impoſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon you, which will not abide the teſt; and for which they have no good proof, if their pretences be examined. You may be ſure if they were well furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with proofs, they would not fear the trial, but deſire to have all brought to the touch-ſtone, that Truth may be differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from its counterfeit. No body refuſes to be judged, but he that knows his cauſe is naught, and fears he ſhall be caſt. Such men had need do all they can to lurk in the dark, and put off their ſtuff when no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can ſee what it is; who know it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully wrought, and will not abide the
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:204181:289"/>light. They do wiſely and as cunning Merchants, who make up in words and great aſſurances of their honeſty, what is wanting in the goodneſs of their wares. But why we ſhould have ſo little wit as to take their words, who can tell? We muſt anſwer for this folly, no doubt, to Almighty God; who hath given us more underſtanding if we would uſe it, and taught us by himſelf to call for good wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of that, which is offered to us for a truth. And the more ſtrictly we examine <hi>theſe</hi> which S. <hi>John</hi> here alledges, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we ſhall be ſatisfied that they intend not to deceive us. Which is a mark we ſhould always have much in our eye, when we are enquiring after Truth. If the more we ſearch, conſider and ponder the proofs which are brought, the better they appear, and the clearer they grow; it is a very good ſign there is nothing wanting to make it fully entertain'd, but only longer thoughts, and greater and more ſerious conſideration. As on the other hand, we have great reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and turn away from that, which the longer we weigh its proofs, the lighter they ſeem: and the propounders of them alſo begin to ſhift and ſhuffle, till they have put all into a miſt, in which we can
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:204181:290"/>ſee nothing, but that they are at a loſs, and are fain to puzzle us, becauſe they cannot clear that which they were about. Thanks be to God there is nothing of this in the evidences we give, for the true Chriſtian Religion. They are plain and perſpicuous, and ſhow themſelves in a greater brightneſs, the more we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and the better we are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them. Search and try what has been ſaid, and the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt will ſhine with greater luſtre in your eyes, and you will confeſs with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 i. 3. that <hi>he hath called us to the knowledge of him, by glory and vertue;</hi> that is, by a moſt amazing power of God, which declared him to be his only Son, our Lord.</p>

                        <p>Let us therefore in the next place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſeriouſly, how excellent and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rational the Faith of Chriſtians is. There is nothing founded upon ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as our moſt holy Religion. It is no childiſh, ſilly thing, to be a believer. A man doth not betray his weakneſs and eaſie credulity, when upon examination and ſearch he ſuffers his Soul to be planted
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:204181:290"/>with theſe new Principles; but demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the ſtrength, the nobleneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of his mind, which can diſcern and judge aright: for nothing can pretend to ſo much reaſon as they. There are a vaſt heap of things, which I could here accumulate, beſide thoſe which I have treated of, to make good this aſſertion. But becauſe the method of the Apoſtle which I have followed, is ſo clear and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and the Witneſſes ſo full and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that every one of them affords us many evidences; I will content my ſelf with a brief review of what hath been ſaid. Which will be ſufficient to convince us, that <hi>our Faith is the higheſt improvement of our Reaſon;</hi> and doth not debaſe, but clevate and raiſe our underſtanding, upon the ſureſt grounds of Divine demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if you conſider what Teſtimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als they brought along with them, who have pretended to ſpeak in God's name, you will find there is nothing comparable to the Witneſs which God hath given of his Son. No, not in that Religion which was really founded by his Authority; much leſs in that where there was only the <hi>Name</hi> of God pretended, without any <hi>Power.</hi>

At what time, or in what place, and in whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience did God ſay to him, <hi>Thou art my Prophet?</hi> When did a voice from Heaven come to any three, or but one man, and ſay, <hi>This is the Apoſtle of God, hear him?</hi> It is a marvellous Providence of God, that this Impoſtor, who wanted no confidence, ſhould never adventure in all the relations he hath made of himſelf (quite contrary to our Lord who wrote nothing of his own life, but left all to his Diſciples) to tell any ſuch ſtory as this, for his greater cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and glory among his followers. We read indeed of ſome idle tales which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, of an Angel ſpeaking to him; and
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:204181:291"/>of his aſcenſion into Heaven, I know not how many millions of miles: But what witneſs was there of theſe things? what was his name, who ſaw the Angel appear to him? or who ſtood by, when he was tranſported and carried out of ſight, as he dreamed? Or when and to whom did <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> or any one elſe appear, and verifie it, that he had been with them in glory? If we muſt take his own word, which is all we can hear of to vouch it, then we muſt not refuſe to believe every fooliſh fellow, who has impudence enough to pretend to propheſie. But what then will become of the faith of <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf, if the ſword were out of his hand? Let us hear ſuch a man as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt (whoſe piety and vertue is atteſted by thoſe who were no Friends of our Religion) affirm that he heard and ſaw ſuch things as he reports; and we will be content to abate them the Apoſtles, and ſuch a multitude of people, as heard God ſay he would <hi>Glorifie his Name,</hi> in our Saviour. And in what Glory hath that falſe Prophet appeared ſince he left the World? Whoſe eyes hath he ſtruck out, with the brightneſs of his countenance? Nay, by whom hath he been ſo much as ſeen ſince he was buried? I need not put the queſtion about his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:204181:292"/>for they never pretended it. Only the ſottiſh people would not believe when he died, that he was really dead, but ſaid he was taken up to Heaven, as <hi>Jeſus</hi> was. And <hi>Omar,</hi> one of his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, threatned death to them that ſhould ſay he was dead; for he was only gone away as <hi>Moſes</hi> did into the Mount, and would return again. From whence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps aroſe that vulgar error among us, that the <hi>Mahumedans</hi> expect the return of their Prophet
<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceek. in Gregor. Abul Phar. p.</hi> 180. 264.</note>. But <hi>Abu Becri</hi> proved to them out of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that He was to die as other Prophets before him, and ſo appeaſed <hi>Omar</hi> and the multitude.</p>
                        <p>And was it ever heard that the Holy Ghoſt ſell down upon him, in a viſible ſhape while he lived? There is not one of his own followers (as the learned Mr. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock</hi> aſſures us) who makes any mention, ſo much as of the Pigeon, which, as we commonly tell the tale, was wont to flie to his ear, as if it whiſpered ſome revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him. There was not that ſmall imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, of what is recorded of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Much leſs was there any ſuch glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body ſeen deſcending on him, as that which came down like a Dove, and crowned our Saviours head. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:204181:292"/>never opened to him; nor was he transfigured in the preſence of any of his diſciples. Where are the Books that can tell us of any ſuch thing? or ſo much as of any miracles, which he wrought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Doctrine? He himſelf ſays in his <hi>Alcoran</hi> more than once, that <hi>he was not ſent with Miracles, but with Arms.</hi> And though his followers afterward pretended that he did work miracles, yet they never pretend they were done frequently; and moſt of them are very ridiculous and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; and their learned men do not at all rely upon them, nor think he proved his Prophecy by this means. There is no news of any blind-mans eyes that he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or of his making the lame to walk, or cleanſing a poor Leper; much leſs of a dead-mans hearing his voice, and ariſing out of his grave, and of ſuch like things done by his followers: which we are ſure, from eye-witneſſes, our Lord did, and gave thoſe that teſtifie it power to do the ſame wonders. And if we go to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the Witneſs of <hi>Water,</hi> in Holineſs of Doctrine and Life; what a ſink of dirty ſtuff is his <hi>Alcoran?</hi> The pleaſures of the fleſh are the higheſt that he had in his thoughts to propound to his followers. His Heaven is no better than a ſenſual Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:204181:293"/>But as for the joys of the Holy Ghoſt, or a taſte of any ſpiritual delights, he ſeems to have had no more ſenſe of them than a Swine. How ſhould he, being an impure laſcivious beaſt himſelf; who had ſeventeen Wives, beſides Concubines? And not content with theſe, took another mans Wife (the wife of his ſervant <hi>Zaid</hi>) and pretended a revelation for it. Which, he had the impudence to ſay, told him that God was not only well pleaſed he ſhould have her, but took it ill he had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained ſo long from her, out of fear what the world would ſay. Whereas he ought to have feared God, rather than men. What could be expected from ſuch a Brute, but ſuch a Book as he has left; a mere heap or dunghill rather of filthy non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? And if we enquire further for the Witneſs of BLOUD, we can find none but the <hi>Bloud</hi> of other men, which bears witneſs that he was a falſe Prophet. For his buſineſs was to ſhed the bloud of his oppoſers, rather than to give his own, as a teſtimony to the truth. The ſword was his principal weapon, to ſubdue men to his belief. He did not perſwade them by arguments, but compelled them to yield by force of arms. <hi>Go,</hi> ſays he, in the xix. Section of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and <hi>kill all thoſe who
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:204181:293"/>will not be converted.</hi> He was a Murderer as well as a Lyar (like the firſt Deceiver of all) ſo that to ſave their Bodies rather than their Souls, his neighbours found it the beſt way to ſubmit themſelves to his yoke. Did our bleſſed Saviour uſe any ſuch violence? Did he come with a ſword in his hand and ſay, Yield your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, or your throats? No, <hi>he came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi> He would not let his Apoſtles call for fire from Heaven to conſume any body, though it had been as eaſie for him to do, as to ſend the Holy Ghoſt in fiery tongues upon them. He never did any miracle to the hurt of the ſmalleſt living creature; though it would have been recompenſed by a multitude of noble cures, that he wrought for their owners. It did not pleaſe him, that one of his ſervants cut off but the ear of <hi>Malchus,</hi> though it was in <hi>his</hi> defence. He was the <hi>good ſhepherd,</hi> who would not kill the ſheep, but laid down his life for them. This we comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate perpetually, to his eternal praiſe: whereas the falſe Prophet hath left no other memory, but that he was more like a Wolf than a Shepherd; for he came for nothing but to worry and deſtroy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="562" facs="tcp:204181:294"/>But he doth not deſerve ſo much regard, as to be thus ſeriouſly confuted; were not all this ſaid, rather to make us ſenſible of the excellence of our own Religion, than to diſprove that which was taught by him. Whoſe greateſt wiſdome was, that he choſe to begin to make his Proſelytes and plant his Religion, among a company of rude People; who were more like Beaſts, I told you, than Men. If they had been Men of any underſtanding, one cannot imagine how they ſhould have given cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to ſuch ill contrived tales, as thoſe which he invented. But we are told by his own followers that the People of <hi>Mecca</hi> (a place famous for his Tomb at this day) could neither write nor read, but were perfectly ignorant. Nay, <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf was wont to ſay, that <hi>he was ſent by God to an illiterate Nation.</hi> Which they expound of the <hi>Arabians</hi> about <hi>Mecca;</hi> who were not <hi>People of the Book,</hi> as they call the Jews and Chriſtians, but as ignorant as they came out of their Mothers Womb (ſays one of their own Authors) having never learnt the art of writing, or of caſting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Which ſhows how vaſtly different the beginnings of that Religion were, from thoſe of ours; which was preached to the wiſeſt and politeſt People upon Earth, as
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:204181:294"/>that was to the moſt rude and ſtupid. The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> ſoon ſaw their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries filled with this new Doctrine. Nor was it in the power of their Philoſophers or Orators to ſtop its progreſs. But there were no ſuch Creatures among thoſe wild <hi>Arabians,</hi> and thoſe Philoſophers who aroſe afterwards of this Sect, were aſhamed, it may be made appear by good proofs, of the Alcoran. So deſtitute they are of any thing whereby to ſupport the Religion of that Book, that they are fain to fly to the Goſpel of Chriſt, from thence to gain ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to it. There, ſays the <hi>Saracen,</hi> in <hi>Theodorus Abucara;</hi> Chriſt wrote theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>I ſend you a Prophet called Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met;</hi> but Chriſtians have blotted it out of their Books. For He they fancy is the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclet</hi> whom our Saviour promiſes; and it is one of the Names they beſtow upon this Impoſtor in their writings: who pretends our Saviour foretold his coming, as many have obſerved out of the lxi. Chapter of the <hi>Alcoran</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Hacksp. Dialog. de Paſſione Domin.</note>. Which ſhows how hard they are put to their ſhifts, when they fly to us for refuge; and when Ignorance is the greateſt ſecurity and ſupport to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at this day. It is very remarkable that as our Religion was propagated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:204181:295"/>the wiſeſt and moſt learned Nations, by the moſt illiterate men, meerly by the power of the Spirit and the Holy Ghoſt; ſo being thus propagated, all the learned part of the World is of our Religion. They that are of any other, are ignorant of good learning, as their great enemy. But this fears not to be tried, becauſe it is ſure that knowledge is its Friend, and that wiſdome, as our Saviour ſaid, will be juſtified of her Children. Who clearly ſee even from their own Writings that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> at the beſt, was but an hot Enthuſiaſt, who took his own warm thoughts for inſpiration. But he had no aſſurance of what he ſaid: As the humour wrought he was for new illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. It was not his fault that his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had not another Book, which ſhould have put down the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> For as our famous Profeſſor of this Learning
<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mr. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, Ib. p.</hi> 178.</note> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved out of <hi>Alſhareſtanius,</hi> when he lay ſick of the Fever of which he dyed, he called for Pen and Ink, that he might write them an infallible Book (it ſeems as yet he had not done it) to keep them from err<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he was dead. This <hi>Omar</hi> lookt upon as a frenzy, (though <hi>Mahomet</hi> took it for an inſpiration) and ſaid, <hi>Alas! the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Apostle of God is very strong:</hi> It is ſufficient that we have the Book of God
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:204181:295"/>(<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Alcoran</hi>) there needs no more. But ſome were of another mind: and while the Company that ſtood by contended and ſtrove among themſelves, ſome calling for the Pen and Ink, and others agreeing with <hi>Omar,</hi> that he was beſide himſelf, <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> cryed out, <hi>Get ye gone, it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come you to diſpute before me:</hi> and ſo there was an end. But ſome bewail this as a great misfortune, that he did not write them ſuch a Book, as he then had in his Head: that is, more frenzies and ravings of his brain-ſick imagination.—But it is time to have done with this: which I have ſaid not meerly to ſhow how ſenceleſs that Religion is, which hath over-ſpread ſo great a part of the World; but how happy we are who are taught by our Lord and Maſter Chriſt Jeſus. Whoſe faith relies upon ſuch certain, evident and divine grounds, that if we did but live according to it; we need not fear but by its power and force it would overcome and vanquiſh the other, though ſupported by never ſo numerous followers. The Lord of his infinite mercy quicken our Faith, that we may out-live them; for it is plain we can ſo far out-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon them; that there is no more compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon between our grounds and theirs, than there is between the wiſeſt man that ever
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:204181:296"/>was, and thoſe blocks of <hi>Mecca</hi> that could neither write nor read.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The only Religion that can come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any competition with ours, is that of <hi>Moſes:</hi> who indeed was ſent of God, and as became a faithful ſervant of his, in the Houſe or Family committed to his charge, followed his orders and honeſtly teſtified and reported thoſe things which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to ſpeak, iii. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. But if you ſeriouſly weigh what hath been ſaid, you will find the <hi>Jews</hi> had not ſuch weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Arguments to perſwade them to believe on <hi>Moſes,</hi> as we have to believe in <hi>Jeſus;</hi> who hath abrogated a great part of that Religion.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>first</hi> for the Witneſs of the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, ix. Joh. 29. <hi>We know that God ſpake to Moſes.</hi> But how did they know it? What evidence were they able to give themſelves of it? If it had pleaſed them to lay aſide their paſſion, and look beyond the prejudices of their education, the proof of it would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo ſlender in compariſon with the aſſurances they might have had of his <hi>ſpeaking to Jeſus;</hi> that they would never have added thoſe ſcornful words, which
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:204181:296"/>there follow; <hi>as for this fellow we know not whence he is.</hi> God appeared indeed to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh; and ſaid to him, iii. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 6. <hi>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob.</hi> And bids him ſay to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom he ordered him to go, <hi>I am hath ſent me to you,</hi> verſ. 14. But which of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſtood by, when God ſpake theſe words to him? What perſon was there like <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, to be a Witneſs of this Voice, which was his Commiſſion? What Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was there with him (but the Flock he was feeding) that could come afterward and ſay, I was preſent and heard God call to him out of the Buſh? Doth the Voice ſay any where, <hi>I am hath ſent HIM;</hi> as if it ſpake to others beſides himſelf? or what words did he himſelf hear, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to thoſe which God ſpake to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſaying, <hi>Thou art my Son,</hi> my well-beloved <hi>Son?</hi> Nor was the manner alike wherein theſe two Voices were delivered. One out of the <hi>Buſh,</hi> the other from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And the Glory wherewith this came to <hi>Moſes,</hi> was much inferiour to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearance of the Holy Ghoſt deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Jeſus. An <hi>Angel of the Lord</hi> you read appeared then to <hi>Moſes in a flame of fire,</hi> verſ. 2. But the flame was <hi>in the
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:204181:297"/>midſt of the Buſh,</hi> not upon <hi>Moſes.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> not an Angel of the Lord, came down at our Saviour's Baptiſm, when he <hi>was ſent;</hi> and not into ſome diſtant place, but <hi>lighted upon HIM,</hi> and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. God therefore is ſaid <hi>to DWELL in the Buſh,</hi> xxxiii. Deut. 16. but never to <hi>dwell</hi> in <hi>Moſes;</hi> and the dwelling of God there, was only by the Preſence and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of an Angel. Whereas now Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is the <hi>dwelling place of God,</hi> as I have proved; and it is <hi>God himſelf,</hi> that dwells in him. The Divine Majeſty came upon him, and there it ſetled its abode in his Perſon. Who is <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh;</hi> and whoſe Glory we behold, the Glory as of the only begotten of the Father; which cannot be ſaid of any other man.</p>
                        <p>All this is ſo plain, that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ſaw this appearance of God to him (though ſufficient to perſwade him that he was <hi>ſent of God,</hi> becauſe he heard him ſpeak to him out of the Buſh) would not prove a demonſtration to others; who did not hear or ſee any thing to make them believe him, nor had any credible witneſſes to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie this beſide himſelf. He ſays as much afterward to him that ſent him, <hi>Behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken to my
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:204181:297"/>voice; for they will ſay, the Lord hath not appeared unto thee.</hi> iv. <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. And how could he confute them, when they made this exception? unleſs he had ſome ſenſible demonſtration to give them that God was with him; which God immediately fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes him withall (<hi>ver.</hi> 2.) though nothing like to the Power of our Saviour, as you ſhall hear preſently. All the miracles he wrought were as ſhort of our Lords, as His firſt Commiſſion was; which you ſee plainly was nothing ſo noble, nothing ſo clear, as that of our bleſſed Saviour's. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> himſelf is ſenſible of it, and confeſſes he wanted ſome <hi>Witneſs</hi> that God ſpake to him; and that he knew not what to ſay, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> bade him prove it. But our Lord needed not to call for any Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt a great Prophet, as they themſelves allowed, was ready of himſelf (for it was his office) to declare openly that <hi>he ſaw the Spirit deſcending from Heaven, like a Dove, and abiding on him. He ſaw, and bare record that this is the Son of God:</hi> as the Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in his audience alſo, pronounced him. Which a great many People, if need were, could afterward certifie; who concluded <hi>that an Angel ſpake to him,</hi> as you have heard from S. <hi>John</hi>'s teſtimony .xii. 29.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="570" facs="tcp:204181:298"/>2. Now if you proceed further and ask for ſome Witneſs of <hi>Moſes</hi> his authority, like to that of the WORD (the ſecond Witneſs to our Saviour) who can hear any thing of it? Do we ever read a word of <hi>Moſes</hi> his appearing in ſuch a Glory, as our Lord Jeſus did to his firſt Martyr S. <hi>Steven,</hi> and to S. <hi>Paul</hi> and to his beloved Diſciple? Nay, where are the Witneſſes that ſay he was ſo much as transfigured when he was upon the Mount; or doth he himſelf ever affirm it? When was his Rayment made as white as Snow? or where (as I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine more hereafter) was the <hi>bright cloud</hi> covering the Mount, which was all cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with darkneſs? we read indeed that when he came down <hi>his face ſhone,</hi> but not in ſo bright and glorious a manner as our Saviour's did when he went up into the Holy Mount, and eſpecially after he aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Heaven. Then S. <hi>Steven,</hi> as I have ſaid, <hi>ſaw the Glory of God, and Jeſus ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his right hand;</hi> an honour never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any Angel in Heaven. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſaw him again, in a light <hi>greater than that of the Sun at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi> And to S. <hi>John</hi> he appeared as the KING OF KINGS AND THE LORD OF LORDS, in ſuch a Majeſty as he was
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:204181:298"/>not able to bear, but made him <hi>fall at his feet as dead.</hi> He that weighs ſuch things as theſe will ſee, that all the glory of <hi>Moſes</hi> (to uſe S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 10.) <hi>was no glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glory that excelleth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Then if you look for the Teſtimony of the HOLY-GHOST, I have already noted that it never came down upon him, as it did upon the Founder of our Religion. Much leſs did he ſend it upon ſome ſelect Men after he was dead, who ſhould do as great wonders as himſelf. And ſtill much leſs did he beſtow it upon all the People, as our Lord did for a while, upon all Believers. There is not the ſmalleſt foot-ſtep of any ſuch Honour or Power that he had. For He did not communicate a portion of his Spirit to the LXX. Elders, who were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to be his Aſſiſtants; but <hi>the Lord ſaid to him, I will come down, and take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and put it upon them,</hi> xi. Num. 17. which words do not ſignifie, it is true, that he had leſs, but only that they had more of the Spirit, than before: yet He did not ſo much as lay his hands upon them that they might receive it, but <hi>God took of the Spirit which was on him, and gave it to the LXX. Elders;</hi>
                           <pb n="572" facs="tcp:204181:299"/>even to thoſe two who were not there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Tabernacle, but remained ſtill in the camp, <hi>ver.</hi> 25, 26.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If you go therefore next to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of WATER, how tranſparent is the Purity of our Saviours Doctrine, above that of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Whoſe Laws though they contained nothing diſhoneſt, yet burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people, to prevent a greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of their running into Idolatry, with a number of precepts which in themſelves had no goodneſs at all to commend them. Nay, the Letter of the very moral Law laid reſtraints only upon the outward man, ſo that they who were ſubject to it little regarded the purifying of their ſpirits, from thoſe irregular paſſions and naughty affections, which our Lord expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits. There were many things alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in thoſe days, which our Lord doth not allow. Whoſe deſign was, not only to purge the heart, and make the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of men much better by all his precepts; but to advance them to the nobleſt degree of purity and goodneſs. Where do you read in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſuch precepts of meekneſs, of mortifying fleſhly luſts, of kindneſs to all, and tender compaſſion, of truſt in God, of contentedneſs with the
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:204181:299"/>preſent, and hope of his mercy in another world, as are frequent and obvious in the Goſpel of Chriſt? Nay, in what place of the Law do you find ſo much as one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or exhortation to Pray, much leſs to Pray without ceaſing, and to Pray (not for riches, and victory over enemies, and long life, but) for the Divine Grace and favour, for the Holy Spirit, for remiſſion of ſins, and for Eternal Life? And now I mention that word, I cannot but deſire you to conſider how low and poor the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of <hi>Moſes</hi> were, compared with thoſe of our Saviour, who <hi>hath brought in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hope.</hi> Of which they could ſee ſo little (ſo dim was the light) in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that a whole Sect of men who believed in him and received his Law, caſt away all hope of obtaining good things in another life, and denied the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Dead. And we muſt add to all this, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was but the Light of that one Nation; whereas our Lord ſays, more than once, <hi>I am the Light of the WORLD,</hi> viii. <hi>John</hi> 12. ix. 5. <hi>Moſes</hi> waſhed the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the <hi>Jews;</hi> but now the <hi>hearts</hi> of the unclean <hi>Gentiles are purified by Faith,</hi> xv. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. And if you enquire further into the purity of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his life, you will find it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

But our Lord was perfectly free from all ſpot, the Lamb of God without blemiſh: who never ſpake the leaſt word amiſs, no not in the midſt of ſuch torments as <hi>Moſes</hi> never endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. For if you paſs on to conſider what ſufferings and BLOUD teſtifie; Alas! what is the Bloud of Bulls and of Goats, to the precious Bloud of <hi>Jeſus?</hi> Did <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeal that Covenant of which he was the Miniſter, or did he ſprinkle the Book of the Covenant, with his own bloud? Did he <hi>purge</hi> away <hi>the ſins</hi> of the people <hi>by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> as our Saviour, we read, did? 1. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3. or ſanctifie them <hi>by the offering of his own body</hi> once for all, as it is, x. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10? Did he die to bear Witneſs to the Truth? or witneſs ſuch a good confeſſion before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as <hi>Jeſus</hi> before <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late?</hi> Was it ever heard, that by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during of a ſhameful and cruel death, he declared to all, the certainty of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy? Upon what Altar was he offered? And for what cauſe did he become a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? This was peculiar to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to ſuffer ſuch things as no man ever did; and for
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:204181:300"/>this very cauſe, becauſe he ſaid He was the Son of God.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>Moſes</hi> then had need to do ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to confirm his prophecy, ſince he fell ſhort in many other things of giving ſatisfaction. Such as we have, I mean, who abound in Witneſſes to our belief; and hear even this Witneſs, on which the <hi>Jews</hi> heretofore relied, ſpeak more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and powerfully to us than it did to them. The SPIRIT of the Lord was upon <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> the people ſaw by the wonders he did, which moved them to follow him. Though now they are ſo fooliſhly mad againſt our Saviour, that to rob us of this Argument, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay <hi>Moſes</hi> his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles did not prove him to be ſent of God, yet it is manifeſt by their ſtory, they were, in a manner, his only glory: I am ſure the principal, or that which firſt induced their forefathers to give any credit to him. For when he asked of God a ſign to give the people (who otherwiſe he foreſaw would queſtion the apparition of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to him) that they might believe as much as himſelf, and acknowledge that God ſent him, He granted him a power of doing ſuch wonders as fleſh and bloud could not do, which, it ſeems, he
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:204181:301"/>thought the propereſt means to convince them. <hi>What is that in thy hand, ſaith the Lord</hi> (immediately after the words men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, iv. <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.) <hi>and he ſaid, a rod. And the Lord ſaid, Caſt it on the ground. And he caſt it on the ground, and it became a Serpent, and</hi> Moſes <hi>fled from before it. And the Lord ſaid unto him again, Put forth thine hand and take it by the tail, and he put forth his hand and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand; that they may believe the Lord God of their Fathers hath appeared unto thee, ver.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5. This was the end for which this miracle was to be wrought. To which he adds another, that if they would <hi>not believe him, nor hearken to the voice of the firſt,</hi> they might be convinced by the ſecond; or if they would believe neither, he gave him power to do a third, and bade him turn the water of the river into bloud, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. And accordingly you read, he went <hi>and did the ſigns in the ſight of the people, and the people believed: and when they heard God had viſited them, bowed their heads and worſhipped, ver.</hi> 30, 31. After this indeed they disbelieved again, till God drowned their enemies in the red Sea, and <hi>then the people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord, and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Moſes,</hi> xiv. <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. But were any
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:204181:301"/>of theſe works ſo wonderful, and ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to move belief, as thoſe which our Saviour did? It may deſerve a diſcourſe (on a fitting occaſion) on purpoſe to ſhow how much <hi>Moſes</hi> came behind him in this, as well as in all the reſt. Both the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and greatneſs of our Saviour's works were as far beyond his, as the ſtrength of a Gyant is beyond that of an Infant. He was cut off in the midſt of his days, and yet in that three years and an half wherein he lived, after the SPIRIT of God came upon him at his Baptiſm, he did more wonders than <hi>Moſes</hi> did in forty years; nay, more than had been done from the beginning of the world to that time. And if you regard the quality of them, <hi>Moſes</hi> his taking the Serpent by the tail, and turning it into a rod again, was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to our Saviour's caſting out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, treading upon the old Serpent, breaking in pieces all his power, by heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all manner of ſickneſs and diſeaſe; and giving his Diſciples alſo the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power which was viſible in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Nor was <hi>Moſes</hi> his hand becoming leprous when he put it into his boſom, and its being reſtored again by the ſame means, any thing like to the miracles of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in curing ſo many old Lepers of all
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:204181:302"/>forts, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they came to him to implore his charity. <hi>Moſes</hi> brought a ſtrong Eaſt wind, which cauſed the Sea to go back, and leave the bottom dry for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to march through; but this was nothing ſo wonderful as our Lord's walking upon the Sea, as it had been dry land, and commanding <hi>Peter</hi> to accompany him in the midſt of a boiſterous wind; and his laying his commands upon ſuch tempeſts and raging waves, and the fiſhes alſo, which all obeyed him. Nay, that great miracle of feeding them with Manna, was not ſo ſtrange as our Lord's ſatisfying great multitudes, with five or ſeven loaves and two ſmall fiſhes: which were not propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to ſo many thouſand ſtomachs as were filled by them; as the quantity of Manna was to the Armies of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Beſides that you never read a word of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his opening the eyes of the blind, much leſs of his raiſing the dead, which our Lord did ſundry times. I need ſay no more to ſhow how inferiour he was to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> even in regard of his miracles; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the multitude ſaid truly, <hi>It never was ſo ſeen in Iſrael,</hi> ix. <hi>Matth.</hi> 33. And yet this was the only thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that Nation at the firſt, and made
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:204181:302"/>them believe in <hi>Moſes</hi> (as I have prov'd) before they heard God ſpeak to them, by an Angel, from mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> at the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Law. That was the moſt amazing thing of all; but was after they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and a great while after they had believed <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent of God, as they ſaw then more fully: and was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comparable neither to <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to ſome of the Apoſtles out of Heaven, and ſending the Holy Ghoſt from thence, with the gift of tongues and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, upon them all. And after all that hath been ſaid of the miracles which the SPIRIT wrought by him, where are the miracles that it wrought for him? Did <hi>Moſes</hi> prove himſelf a true Prophet by riſing again, after he was dead and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? To whom did he appear? With whom did he eat and drink? Or who can ſay that he aſcended up into Heaven? To whom did he appear in glory, except it was to our Saviour (and ſome of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples) in honour of whom, it ſeems he had then the favour, and not before, to ſhine in that luſtre wherein they beheld him. In ſhort, God gave not <hi>the Spirit by meaſure</hi> unto <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as you have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: He had not ſuch a limited portion of it as <hi>Moſes</hi> had, who appears by theſe
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:204181:303"/>things to have been only a <hi>ſervant</hi> over the <hi>houſe of God,</hi> in which our Saviour had a power as a <hi>Son,</hi> and that over his <hi>own houſe,</hi> iii. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
                        <p>Thus much hath been ſaid to ſhow the great honour God hath done us in making us Chriſtians. Whoſe Faith, you ſee, ſtands upon ſuch well-laid grounds, that even they who were taught by God had none comparable to them. Herein we have a felicity above all other men that have ever been, if we be but ſenſible of it; that we are not required to receive any thing from God, but upon ſuch reaſons, as far excel thoſe which demanded belief of men in former times, but had not ſuch ſtrength to enforce it.

                     <p>THere is no great skill required, to ſee the difference between that Holy Religion which we profeſs; and all others that are entertained in the reſt of the World. Some we muſt have; and it is as palpable that this is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the moſt excellent, as it is that there is any Religion at all. There is no Nation ſo barbarous, but pays ſome reſpect and ceremony (to uſe the phraſe of <hi>Tully</hi> when he defines Religion) to ſome Superiour and more excellent Nature, which we call Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. <hi>Though they are ignorant what kind of God it becomes them to have, yet they know a God must be had, and muſt be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.</hi> Their own mind teaches them this, as ſoon as they caſt their eyes upon the admirable frame of the World; which
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:204181:306"/>all naturally conclude muſt have had ſome moſt wiſe and mighty Builder. But what reſpect and reverence that is, which will be pleaſing to him, they are very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; it is manifeſt, by the various ways they have invented to expreſs their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They all with one conſent acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a neceſſity of a Revelation to inſtruct them; for there is no Nation but pretends to have received ſome things, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, inſpiration, or apparition of their Gods. That which pure natural reaſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, is not to be found ſimple and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt in any Nation under Heaven. For if we ſhould ſtand meerly to that, it hath ever reſolved that the worſhip of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the ſtudy of Wiſdome, Juſtice and all other Vertues. Which as they are moſt eminent in God, ſo he is beſt pleaſed with them in us. And they that addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to reſemble him in this manner, are the men that ſhall obtain his favour. There are a number of notable ſayings both in Heathen and Chriſtian Writers to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But when all this is ſaid and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, Men will offend againſt theſe Rules of Vertue: and what ſhall they do then? what will make him ſatisfaction, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a reconciliation with him (whom they have reaſon to think their offences
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:204181:306"/>have made their enemy) is a thing that can never be certainly reſolved without a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. Without which alſo we can have little ſecurity of the immortality of our Souls, and of the life to come. Which hath inclined all Mankind to liſten after a Revelation, and to catch at any thing which pretends to come from God to them. For as <hi>Plato</hi> acknowledges (when he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains there ſhould be no alterations made in the ancient Cuſtomes about Sacrifices, becauſe) <hi>it is not poſſible for mortal nature to know any thing of theſe matters,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. No, ſays he, (not long after in the ſame Book
<note n="*" place="margin">In Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom.</note>) as no body ſhall ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me that there is any greater Piety, than true Vertue, and as there is nothing more excellent can be taught, than how thoſe that honour Vertue ſhould rightly worſhip God with Sacrifices and other rites of purifying: So <hi>none can teach this,</hi>

But if we ſearch into all the records that are in the World, what is there that can ſtand in competition with the Chriſtian way of worſhipping God, or pretend to come with ſuch authority from him? I have examined thoſe that have moſt to ſay for themſelves; and they can
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:204181:307"/>produce no ſuch <hi>WITNESSES</hi> as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity doth: No, not that ancient Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by God to <hi>Moſes.</hi> As for the old Pagan ways, which were very various, I am aſhamed to mention them. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt they ſuffered themſelves to be cheated by impure Spirits, and took the anſwers of Daemons for the Oracles of God. But <hi>ask now of the days that are past, which were before us, ſince the day that God created Man upon the Earth, and ask from the one ſide of Heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any ſuch thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it,</hi> that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed appeared among Men, and was <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the fleſh:</hi> as is evident by all the ſigns and wonders and mighty deeds, by voices from Heaven, by his Reſurrection from the dead, and all the other Witneſſes which have teſtified this truth to the world. Ask again, hath God ever aſſured Men of any thing, by ſo many and ſuch evident teſtimonies, as thoſe which I have produced. <hi>Unto us it was ſhown, that we might know,</hi> that Jeſus is the Lord, and <hi>beſide him there is no other</hi> (if I may again allude to the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> iv. Deut. 34, 35.) <hi>out of Heaven</hi> he hath made us hear his voice that he might inſtruct us; and <hi>upon Earth</hi> he hath ſhown us his great
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:204181:307"/>wonders, <hi>that every tongue might confeſs Jeſus is the Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</hi>

                        <p>That now is the next thing I am to preſs, as a neceſſary conſequence of what hath been ſaid in the foregoing Treatiſe.

And he would add, that it was to no purpoſe to ask him what the Honours are which ought to be given to ſuch a perſon, when it is eaſie to be diſcerned, what honour is due to the wiſdome of God: by the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and governance of which, he would ſingularly deſerve of Mankind, and do ſome thing for their Salvation, proper only to himſelf, and which was
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:204181:309"/>above Men to do. Now if theſe things, which I have ſuppoſed, be really done, if there be good records of them, if from a Country, in which alone One God was worſhipped, and where ſuch a perſon was to be born, there came choſen men, who by their Vertues and their Sermons have kindled in Mens breaſts the flame of the Divine love, and have left the inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Earth under a moſt wholeſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, if every where it is preached, that <hi>in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,</hi> if to the perceiving and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing this, (that the Soul may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and recover ſtrength to entertain ſo great a light) the covetous hear ſuch words as theſe, <hi>Lay not up your treaſures upon Earth,</hi> and the luxurious are told, that <hi>he who ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption,</hi> and the proud are told, that <hi>he who exalteth himſelf ſhall be abaſed,</hi> the angry are exhorted <hi>when one cheek is ſmitten to turn the other,</hi> they that live in diſcord are taught, <hi>to love their enemies,</hi> the ſuperſtitious are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, that <hi>the Kingdom of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us,</hi> to the curious it is ſaid continually, <hi>look not at the things that are ſeen, but to thoſe which are not ſeen,</hi> and laſtly it is
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:204181:309"/>ſaid to all, <hi>Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world;</hi> if theſe things are read throughout the world, if they be chearfully heard with great veneration, if after ſo much bloud, ſuch fires, ſo many crucifixions of Martyrs, the Church is grown more fertile, and hath propagated it ſelf to the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations, (and to omit the reſt) if men are every where ſo converted to God, that every day all mankind an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers almoſt with one voice, LIFT UP YOUR HEARTS UNTO THE LORD; why ſhould we drowſily ſtill continue in a ſottiſh unbelief?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is nothing can be ſaid in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of ſuch Souls, as having received no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſuch a marvellous Love of God to mankind, and ſuch evident proofs that it is no fancy; will not be perſwaded to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the belief of it. But when light is come into the world, chuſe to remain in darkneſs; and will be guided merely by themſelves, when there is a revelation come from God. Which ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with the greateſt joy, as the thing which the world wanted and wiſht for: and without which they could meet with no reſolution of their doubts, nor
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:204181:310"/>certain directions how to pleaſe God, whom they had ſo highly offended. In this the Chriſtian Religion gives us full ſatisfaction, and propounds nothing to our practice, but what the wiſeſt men ever ſaid was beſt to be done, and took for the moſt excellent piety. As for that which it propounds to our belief, it is all made credible by this one great Truth, which is proved by a number of Witneſſes, that <hi>Jeſus is the Son of God.</hi> We ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that which ſuch a perſon taught, either with his own mouth, or by thoſe whom he inſpired, and ſent in the ſame manner, as the Father ſent him. For if it be ſo reaſonable, as I have demonſtrated, to be a Believer, then it is as unreaſonable to be an Unbeliever: and no man will be able to open his mouth to juſtifie ſuch a ſin, againſt ſo many Witneſſes as will appear to teſtifie, that they called him to the faith by the cleareſt and the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful evidences that ever were. For if the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound to believe in <hi>Moſes,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no more teſtimony from God than you have heard; we are much more bound to believe in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who hath more and greater Witneſſes that he not only came from God, but is gone to God, and hath all things given into his hands, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:204181:310"/>in Heaven or in Earth. As it was ſaid of them therefore (xiv. <hi>Exod. ult.</hi>) that <hi>they believed the Lord and his ſervant Moſes,</hi> ſo let it be ſaid of every one now, that <hi>we believe the Lord and his Son Jeſus.</hi> For this very end were theſe words writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by S. <hi>John,</hi> that <hi>we may believe on his Name, ver.</hi> 13. And this is the ſumm of what God would have us to do, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment he hath given us; <hi>That we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another,</hi> iii. 23. If we do the former, we ſhall ſee an evident conſequence of the latter. For when we are perſwaded that He is the Son of God, we cannot but ſee that we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every word that he ſays, with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate reverence, and to let every thing that is ſaid concerning him into our very hearts; ſo that we fear him, and love him, and become obedient to him, and depend upon his word, and, as he himſelf hath taught us, honour him as we do the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Almighty.</p>
                        <p>For we are aſſured by thoſe who heard him, and were with him from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and were witneſſes of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and received the Holy Ghoſt from him, that He was the WORD MADE
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:204181:311"/>FLESH; and that the <hi>Word was God,</hi> and <hi>all things were made by him,</hi> and is the <hi>Son of God</hi> not by office only, but in his nature and eſſence, and having aſſumed our Fleſh, therein reigns <hi>Lord of all</hi> for ever. For what reaſon ſhould we refuſe to receive that, which is ſo credibly witneſſed to be the very Truth of God? They that report theſe things were ſo pious, as I have proved, that they cannot be ſuſpected to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented them; nay, the very end for which they publiſhed them, quits them from all ſuſpicion of fraud and forgery. For they aimed at nothing, but by making man ſenſible of his great Dignity, and the high honour God hath put upon him; to poſſeſs his heart with an ardent love to God and to his Neighbour, and to make him perfectly ſubject unto his will. And is there not great reaſon, if we believe what theſe Witneſſes ſay, that we ſhould apply our beſt endeavours to pleaſe him; by living ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, and by abſtaining from the leaſt appearance of evil? Think what <hi>Jeſus</hi> was, and then reſolve with your ſelves what regard is due to his Word. Will not the wicked man tremble, when he hears him ſay, that none ſhall go to Heaven but they that do the will of his Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:204181:311"/>Then he does not believe that theſe are the words of the Son of God, or does not mind what he reads. Who can with any face call him Lord, Lord, and not acknowledge that he ought to do the things that he ſays? And to acknowledge this, and not do thoſe things, what a madneſs is that; if we believe our Lord is able to call us to a ſevere account for our neglect of his will? What is there that can recommend chaſtity and purity of heart to our affection, together with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſs, meekneſs, peaceableneſs, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty or contentedneſs of ſpirit, the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of little children, ſaith in God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſuch like vertues, if this will not; that the Son of God hath preacht them to the world as the moſt amiable qualities in the eyes of God, without which we ſhall never ſee him, nor inherit his Heavenly Kingdom? Are not theſe his words? Do not his Sermons teach us theſe Leſſons? And if we do theſe things, does he not ſay we ſhall <hi>have everlaſting life,</hi> and <hi>enter into his joy,</hi> and <hi>ſee the glory which God hath given him?</hi> For what cauſe do we queſtion whether this be the way to happineſs? Do not the ſame <hi>Witneſſes</hi> which tell us that he is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie withall that he came to teach us
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:204181:312"/>Gods will, and that this is his will, which by the Goſpel is declared unto us? Why do we not ſeriouſly believe it then, let me ask again? Are not the Witneſſes good, who affirm that Jeſus is the Son of God? Have we not examined them, and find no cauſe why we ſhould reject them? Or will you receive nothing upon the credit of a Witneſs? That's a very ſtrange obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; which rejects ſo certain a way of knowing many things, that cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways known.</p>
                        <p>For the notices of things do not come to us all one way, but by divers means, either by our <hi>Senſes,</hi> or by our <hi>Reaſon</hi> and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or by <hi>Report.</hi> By all theſe ways the knowledge of things is conveyed to our Mind: And if we refuſe to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by any of them, there are a great number of things, certainly true and of great conſequence to us, of which we muſt remain ignorant. That there are other Countries far diſtant from this where we live, and that ſuch and ſuch things are there to be had, and have been there done, moſt Men can know by no means but only by report; for there are but few that can go and ſee. And he that will not receive the teſtimony of another in this caſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:204181:312"/>himſelf of a conſiderable piece of knowledge, whereof others partake; and which might be as uſeful to him as it proves to them. But if for this wilful loſs he ſhall pretend to aſſign a juſt cauſe; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he cannot believe any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be demonſtrated to him by clear and evident conſequences from Principles of known reaſon, he will become ridiculous. For it is abſurd to expect the knowledge of any thing in any other way, but that which is proper for its conveyance to us. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a proof of a matter of reaſon, from our ſenſes; or for what we diſcern by our ſenſes, from our reaſon; is equally ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: and ſo it is to demand an evidence for things of Faith (which we know by report only) either from our Senſes or our Reaſon. That there are ſome things come to our notice only by Faith, is plain from what paſſes every day. And it is as plain, that they muſt be proved to be true in their proper way; that is, by the ſoundneſs of the Teſtimony upon which we receive them: As no man requires a reaſon for what he ſees and feels, nor asks that he may ſee with his eyes that of which he reaſons and diſcourſes: ſo he ought not to ſeek for a teſtimony of ſenſe or reaſon, for that which he can know by no way but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:204181:313"/>As for example; no Man demands a reaſon to prove that the Sun ſhines; In this his ſenſe gives him ſatisfaction; and if he were born blind, no reaſon could prove to him that it was not Night. Nor does any man, that is in his wits, require that he may behold God with his eyes, whom he knows by diſcourſe and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his mind; and knows him alſo by that to be inviſible. In like manner it is altogether prepoſterous, when a man comes and reports that ſuch a perſon dyed on ſuch a day; to ask for a reaſon to prove it, or to demand that he may ſee it; for it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſee him dye again upon that day. That is not a thing to be known either of thoſe ways, by ſenſe or reaſon, but only by the teſtimony of others who were preſent at that time, and are, we think, worthy of belief. Why do we ask then for any other proof, that Jeſus was born of a Virgin at ſuch a time, did ſuch wonderful works, preached ſuch an holy Doctrine, was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, dead and buried, roſe again from the dead, aſcended to Heaven, and ſent from thence the Holy Ghoſt? Theſe are not things now to be ſeen or felt, nor can we gather them from the meer diſcourſe of our own reaſon, which tells us nothing of them: But we have them by report from
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:204181:313"/>a great many <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> who ſay they ſaw and heard and felt all that which they would have us believe. There is no other uſe of reaſon in this caſe, but only to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and judge whether this report be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and founded in the teſtimony of God. Now that is evident to any impartial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer, from what hath been ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> whoſe report there is no reaſon to ſuſpect, as it is certain it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be diſproved. Why ſhould we then be ſo much our own enemies, as to deprive our ſelves of this ſaving knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt? That is, why do we not give credit to the report of theſe Witneſſes concerning Jeſus; ſince, by the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means, whereby ſuch things can be proved, I have made it good that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declared him to be his Son; and He appeared in Glory to teſtify to himſelf; and the Holy Ghoſt demonſtrated he could be no leſs; and his Life, Death, Reſurrection, and all the reſt (of which there were ſo many upright Witneſſes) aſſure us that it is a certain truth. Would we be ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be perſwaded to go to a Man or a Place, where ſeveral honeſt neighbours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us, upon their word, nay upon their life, we ſhould be promoted to great honor, or be poſſeſſed of a fair eſtate? Do we not
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:204181:314"/>believe one another in our daily traffick? and drive conſiderable bargains, merely upon the credit we give to ſome perſons, who inform us of the advantage we may make by them? Do not men undertake long journeys, and more dangerous voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, merely becauſe they are told that ſuch an one is dead to whom they are heir, or that ſuch rich commodities are to be had in exchange for meaner goods? Who is there that does not deſire his Witneſſes may be accepted and their teſtimony ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for good proof, either to clear his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, or to ſettle his eſtate? Now, ſays the Apoſtle (immediately after the alledging of all theſe Witneſſes in Heaven and in Earth, to prove the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity) <hi>If we receive the Witneſs of men, the Witneſs of God is greater: for this is the Witneſs of God, which he hath teſtified of his Son.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The meaning of which is this; If men whoſe honeſty you cannot impeach, give their teſtimony in a Court of Judicature, it is never diſallowed, nor can you be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſet it by, and make nothing of it; but it is neceſſarily admitted, for an end of ſtrife. The weightieſt cauſes are decided, all matters depending are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:204181:314"/>and judged, according to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that is given by witneſſes of unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed faith. <hi>In the mouth of two or three witneſſes</hi> (as the known ſaying was) <hi>every word</hi> (or rather, matter) <hi>is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> That is, brought to an iſſue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, if any controverſie have aroſe to unſettle it. Nay, the teſtimony of one man, if we have no reaſon to ſuſpect his credit, is in our own private thoughts, though not in Law, ſatisfaction great enough to aſſure us of the truth of what he ſays: And we think it ſuch a reproach to give him the lye, that we cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him; finding a deſire in the ſame caſe to be believed our ſelves. Now if things ſtand thus between us and our neighbours, will we not allow God (ſays the Apoſtle) as much as we yield to them? Shall not his word determine and conclude us? When he gives evidence of a thing, ſhall we ſtill diſpute it with him? That, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the undutifulneſs of it, is too great a ſtubborneſs. We may rather be taught how to behave our ſelves towards him, by the meaſure men expect from us, and we from them: Yea, God does more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve credit than any man; for, as he adds, <hi>the witneſs of God is GREATER, i. e.</hi> is of far more validity and certainty;
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:204181:315"/>it may more ſecurely be relied on, than the witneſs of any men whatſoever. God is not only greater than men, but his <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> alſo or Teſtimony is greater (which muſt be carefully noted) it is of more force and ſtrength to ſupport any concluſion; we may more undoubtedly found our faith upon it; becauſe it is not liable to any of thoſe exceptions which may prejudice the beſt teſtimony of men. <hi>Two</hi> things there are that leſſen the teſtimony of men, if we compare it with God's, and make it to be of a nature more weak and infirm. The <hi>one</hi> is, that though a man be reputed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and therefore we cannot legally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt his Teſtimony, yet it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he may be a deceiver, and we cannot look into his heart to know whether he be or no. We may not be able to prove the leaſt deceit by him, in what he ſays or ever has ſaid or done; and it is poſſible he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver delivered any thing contrary to truth, or did any thing contrary to juſtice: but yet we can never free our mind from this thought, ſince we know not his inward man, that there is a poſſibility alſo, it may be otherwiſe with him. But then <hi>ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſuppoſe him perfectly honeſt, and that it is impoſſible he ſhould put a cheat upon us; yet it will be always poſſible that he
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:204181:315"/>may be cheated himſelf, becauſe all men are fallible and may be miſtaken. The greateſt integrity in the world cannot ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a man, but the weakneſs of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and the ſubtilty of others may ſometimes impoſe upon him: ſo that though he thinks what he ſays to be true, it may be otherwiſe in it ſelf than it is in his thoughts. Herein therefore the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of God is GREATER than the teſtimony of men, that it is not liable to either of theſe ſuſpicions; it being utterly impoſſible that he ſhould either be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf, or that he ſhould deceive us. He can neither lead us into an error (which we all acknowledge to be contrary to his Goodneſs and Truth) nor fall into one himſelf, which is as contrary to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his underſtanding, and his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent being. The teſtimony of God then being ſo indubitable, that it is above the teſtimony of any men, it ought with all reverence to be received when he declares that <hi>Jeſus is his Son:</hi> for if it were but equal to humane teſtimony, it ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. Now <hi>this is the WITNESS OF GOD,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>which he hath te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified of his Son.</hi> That is, It being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be moſt rational that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the teſtimony of God, nay, give it
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:204181:316"/>greater reſpect than we bear to that of men; I aſſure you that the evidence which we give you concerning <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the very teſtimony of God; and therefore do not ſlight it. It is not we that bear witneſs to him, ſo much as God. We do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to hear merely what we ſay, but what God himſelf hath ſaid, who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven many aſſurances of this truth. If there were but <hi>two</hi> of them, they might, by your own rules, very well expect to find entertainment; but there are no leſs than <hi>ſix</hi> witneſſes, every one of them Divine, they all ſpeak from God, and therefore you cannot deny your aſſent to what they prove. For the <hi>firſt</hi> witneſs, is <hi>God the Father himſelf,</hi> who called <hi>Jeſus</hi> his well-beloved Son. And the <hi>ſecond,</hi> is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> upon which account, whatſoever he ſays, is God's teſtimony alſo. The Holy Ghoſt, which is the <hi>third,</hi> that <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Father,</hi> and came on purpoſe to bear witneſs to his Son. As for the <hi>fourth</hi> (Water) <hi>the Doctrine was of GOD,</hi> his life was the <hi>life of GOD, John</hi>'s Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm <hi>was from Heaven,</hi> and he is called (i. <hi>John</hi> 6.) <hi>a man ſent from GOD.</hi> Then, for the <hi>Bloud</hi> which is the <hi>fifth</hi> witneſs, it is called <hi>GOD's own Bloud,</hi> xx. <hi>Acts</hi> 28. And it appeared to be his, by his gathering
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:204181:316"/>it up again after it was ſhed, and taking it into the Heavens, where he appears with it in the preſence of God for us. And the laſt of theſe witneſſes is expreſly called the <hi>Spirit of GOD,</hi> xii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. So that it is <hi>GOD,</hi> you ſee, who ſo many ways bears witneſs of his Son; there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Divine in every one of theſe <hi>Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> in thoſe <hi>on Earth</hi> as well as in thoſe <hi>in Heaven;</hi> and therefore we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an affront to GOD reject their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. For then He would have worſe meaſure from us than men have, and we ſhould give leſs reſpect to ſix Witneſſes of his, than to two or three of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. If <hi>Jeſus</hi> came not with clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, with fulneſs of proof, then deny him any admittance; but if God hath ſo many ways juſtified him to be his Son, if his Life was ſo excellent, his Bloud ſo holy, his Spirit ſo Divine, then we ſhall never be able to juſtifie it before any knowing man, much leſs before God, if we do not believe him: and that heartily and fully, in every thing; no more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the truth of what he ſays, than we do of thoſe things which our eyes and our ears report to us, or of thoſe, which are delivered unto us, upon the faith of the whole world.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="608" facs="tcp:204181:317"/>For which end it ſhould be our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that our Faith may reſt upon a ſure and ſtrong foundation; and be laid on ſuch grounds, that it may ſtand the faſter, in a time of temptation. The ignorant man's Faith indeed may be as ſtrong, as his that knows moſt, and what he hath learnt by Education, may be ſo confirmed by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, that he will never ſtir from it: but is only the effect of Nature, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the ſame reſolutions in thoſe who are of other Religions. The Chriſtian way of obtaining a ſtrong Faith, is firſt to <hi>ſee the Son,</hi> and then <hi>to believe on him to everlaſting life,</hi> as our Saviour himſelf teaches us, vi. <hi>John</hi> 40. To <hi>ſee him</hi> is to perceive and diſcern by evident tokens that he is the Son of God, the true way to life: upon which ſight and plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations we ought to <hi>believe in him,</hi> and ſubmit unto him, as our Lord. That's the true <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> which flows from knowledge, and is founded upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of what ſuch Witneſſes as theſe ſay concerning <hi>Jeſus.</hi> It relies upon the teſtimony of the <hi>Father,</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is wrought by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and confirmed by <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Bloud.</hi> And therefore we ought to ſtudy this place
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:204181:317"/>of holy Scripture, and have it much in our thoughts, that ſo our <hi>Faith may stand in the Power of God.</hi> For otherwiſe, how ſhall we be able to follow the Apoſtolical Precept, which would have us, when we are queſtioned, <hi>to render a reaſon of the hope that is in us,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 15. We may be able to ſtand our ground though we be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the true cauſes of belief; but the enemies of it will look upon it as a fooliſh obſtinacy, if we have not ſo much underſtanding as to give ſome other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>our</hi> Faith, than they give for <hi>theirs.</hi> Suppoſe they ſhould ſay, Why are you a Chriſtian? whence is it that you look for a Reſurrection, a Glorious body, and Eternal life in another world? Would they not think us very ſtupid, if we could ſay nothing to them but that ſo we have been always taught, and are reſolved to believe? Would not this be as good a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for them as it is for us; and make us unworthy of the name of Chriſtians, who know our Books no better, which bid us give, and furniſh us with, a reaſonable account? Conſider therefore what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you would ſhape to them, that ſhould make ſuch a demand. The Apoſtle ſays it is fit they ſhould have a reaſon, what is the beſt that you can offer for their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction?
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:204181:318"/>ſhall I tell you? The plain An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is this, That <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whoſe Religion we follow, was the Son of God; and therefore we believe theſe things becauſe the Son of God taught us ſo, who cannot deceive us; and we will not exchange this for any other perſwaſion though we ſhould die for it. It is certain enough that every body who hears this, will preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to us, that he is a fool who doth not ſtoop to him and comply with us, if it be certain that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Son of God. But how do you prove that, will be the next queſtion. Here is the labour, this is our work; and whence will you fetch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Arguments, to make them yield to you this weighty point? There is no ſuch Compendious Abridgment of them any where, that I know of, as in this place of S. <hi>John,</hi> which furniſhes us with reaſons both many and mighty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us and others that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Son of God. You may tell them that the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Almighty</hi> ſaid ſo, by voices from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the audience of credible perſons; and that the <hi>Word</hi> ſaid ſo, as they may be informed of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had no reaſon greater than this to force him to leave all, and with the daily hazard of his life to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Jeſus.</hi> You may alledge the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:204181:318"/>of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> both at his Baptiſm and afterward; the marvellous ſanctity of his Doctrine and Life; the Confeſſion he made at his bloudy Death; the Glory of his Miraculous works; his Reſurrection from the Dead; the Power of the ſame Spirit in his Apoſtles, after he was gone to Heaven; all the Miracles which were wrought long after their times, in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the holy Martyrs of Jeſus ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; together with the wonderful ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of theſe Witneſſes, who perſwaded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable People in all Countries, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſubjects of this crucified King, Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                        <p>Study this place therefore, I ſay again, very well, that you may be able to oppreſs any gain-ſayer, with the great weight of thoſe reaſons, which you render of your faith. And ſtudy it likewiſe, till you feel the faith of Jeſus doing ſomething in your hearts; till that faith which hath ſo good a cauſe, have ſutable effects: that is, till it change you, as it is ever apt to do, into the nature of that cauſe from whence it flows. It comes from God; ſee that it carry you to him, and change you into his likeneſs. It relies on his Teſtimony, be ſure that it make you perfectly of his mind. It comes with the authority from the Word
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:204181:319"/>of God it ſelf, and from the Holy Ghoſt, let it mightily inſpire you with devotion to him, and ſet your affections on things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, where Chriſt is now at God's right hand. It relies upon the Purity of his holy Doctrine and Life; and therefore ought to purifie our hearts, that we may behave our ſelves in all holy converſation and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. It is founded on his Bloud, on which we can never look, but it will dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our affections to this World, and make us crucifie the fleſh, with its paſſions and luſts. It ſtands upon the power of God, and ſhould therefore make us ſtrong in the Lord and in the power of his might. It grows, as you ſee, upon ſundry roots, and flows from ſeveral heads; and therefore ſhould diſpoſe thoſe in whoſe hearts it is planted, to be abundant in the work of the Lord, and to bring forth much fruit: that we may be known to be indeed the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Jeſus, whoſe faith is ſupported by ſuch numerous Witneſſes. And this now will lead me to the next thing, which S. <hi>John</hi> here makes to be the neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of this faith; and therefore ought not to be omitted.</p>

                        <p>If there be ſuch great, ſuch abundant reaſon to believe that Jeſus is the Son of God, then there is as great a neceſſity lying upon us to be obedient unto him, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to obſerve all his commands. This Faith both requires our ſubmiſſion and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him, and alſo gives us power and ability to perform it. It is a meer trick of the Devil, another piece of his Sophiſtry, when He cannot dig up the foundation of Chriſtianity (which I told you was his firſt indeavour) to hinder all ſuperſtructure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: by perſwading Chriſtian People, that Faith and Obedience are no neceſſary Companions; but that they may be good believers, and yet not keep Chriſt's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. Some think they need not; and others, which is the ſame cheat in another ſhape, think they cannot. But I appeal to every Man's conſcience if he be a believer, whether he do not perceive his heart over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed, and his will inclined to reverence and ſubjection, and all his powers mightily moved to tender their ſervice; when he ſeriouſly thinks that Jeſus is the Lord, to whom God the Father hath committed all Judgment, and will render to every Man
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:204181:320"/>according to his works? Do you not feel this faith carrying a great authority with it? Nay, is there not an irreſiſtable ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and vertue in it, while you attend to it, preſſing you to conformity with his holy will? Who can gain-ſay this? And who can ſay then, that his Faith does not both engage and inable him to be obedient to his Saviour, if he do but mind what he believes? He never thinks of that, but it powerfully urges and conſtrains him, to yield himſelf to be a faithful Servant of Jeſus; in every thing that he declares to be the mind and will of God. Theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable inclinations declare to us ſo plainly the tendency and natural diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtian Faith, that we cannot but ſee, it is ſo far from being ſeparable from obedience; that this is eſſentially included in it, and freely flows from it, if it may be but ſuffered to have its courſe, and not be croſſed in its clear intention and deſign. If you be not convinced of this by what you feel, you may learn it of S. <hi>John,</hi> who tells you here what the natural iſſue of our faith is, and what duty it exacts: for it is the ſcope of theſe words which I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, to lay ſuch a foundation of belief, as may unavoidably inforce obedience, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we forget what our belief is. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:204181:320"/>you know this <hi>Fifth</hi> Chapter of his Epiſtle with this Principle, that <hi>every one who believes Jeſus to be the Christ, is born of God:</hi> and from thence infers (in that and in the ſecond Verſe) that ſuch a perſon cannot but <hi>love God and all his Brethren:</hi> which Love cannot be diſcerned by any thing, but <hi>by keeping his Commandments. FOR THIS IS THE LOVE OF GOD</hi> (ver. 3.) <hi>THAT WE KEEP HIS COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANDEMENTS.</hi> Here is the natural fruit of Faith; This is its Progreſs, if you do not ſtop its motions. It begets in our heart a great Love; and Love, is to be O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient; and that to all God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which reſpect either our duty to him, or to our Neighbour. It is in vain to ſay we believe in Jeſus, if we do not heartily love God who ſent him to us. And it is in vain to pretend love to God, if we keep not his Commandments. And it is as vain to ſay we have a dutiful reſpect to his Commandments, if our neighbour have any cauſe to complain of us. <hi>For he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen? And this Commandment we have from him, that he who loveth God, love his Brother alſo.</hi> iv. 20, 21.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="616" facs="tcp:204181:321"/>Here now, they who have leſs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the grounds of Faith, may make up what is wanting in their knowledge, by the heartineſs of their Devotion to God, and the unfeignedneſs of their love to all their Brethren. If they be mightily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with what they believe, and out of an honeſt love in their hearts to his holy Precepts, be very diligent in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; it will ſupply the defect that is in their underſtanding of the Reaſons why they believe in Jeſus. For if a ſmall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a weak and dull underſtanding, does the ſame work with a ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a quick and piercing, where lies the difference; but only that the One can ſerve Religion more with his mind and diſcourſe, the other meerly with his good will and his pious life? But will any man preſume to be ſo impious, as to imploy his will to find out ways to excuſe his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him, whom he acknowledges for his Lord? He ſhould rather conſider ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly how reaſonable and how neceſſary it is, that he who knows ſo well what Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is, and how <hi>he came,</hi> ſhould above all other Men do him the moſt faithful and zealous ſervice. For if we do but obſerve how many arguments here are to perſwade
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:204181:321"/>us to this Faith in Jeſus, with what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he was ſent, and with what power he came to us; we ſhall think it was for ſome very great work: and fell it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, while we are ſenſible of this, not to do what he requires, though now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it ſeem impoſſible to be done. He is not come of himſelf; but hath the mark and ſtamp of the Supreme Lord upon him. He evidently ſhows that he hath a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God; and brings (as I may ſay) the Broad-ſeal of Heaven with him, to warrant what he demands, though it be never ſo great a tribute of Obedience. Here are <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to him above all exception; and they all bid us behave our ſelves ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſively towards him, and not deny to do any thing that he would have us. <hi>Him hath God the Father ſealed,</hi> as he tells us, vi. Joh. 27. and by his Voice from Heaven commands us to <hi>HEAR HIM.</hi> Which was as if he had ſaid, If you will believe him that cannot lye, then Jeſus is the TRUTH: to every word of whoſe mouth we ought to hearken; that is, faithfully obey and obſerve. For as God is ſaid to hear us, when he grants our deſires; ſo we hear him or his Son, when we fulfill his pleaſure. The WORD likewiſe (2.) when he appeared to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> made him
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:204181:322"/>an Apoſtle, <hi>for obedience to the faith among all Nations,</hi> i. Rom. 5. And told him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly that he appeared to him for this end, that he might ſend him to the Gentiles, <hi>to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> xxvi. Act. 16, 18. The HOLY GHOST likewiſe (3.) is a Witneſs of this, which was <hi>given to thoſe that obeyed him.</hi> v. Act. 32. But lookt upon all wickedneſs as an high af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to it; at which it was <hi>grieved,</hi> and by which it was <hi>quenched;</hi> nay, forced to <hi>depart,</hi> as not induring to dwell in the ſame Houſe with filthineſs and impurity. Unto which the <hi>Water</hi> (4.) or the Holy life and purity of our Saviour in all his actions as well as his Doctrine, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite. And tells us that we muſt be obedient, if there were no other reaſon for it but this alone, that the Son of God himſelf was ſo in every thing. Did God exact obedience of him, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand none of us? Will he ſet us free from that duty and ſervice, to which his dearly beloved Son was ſtrictly tyed? He fulfilled all righteouſneſs, and obſerved even that Law of Ceremonies, to which we have no obligation: And do we think to be hereby excuſed from paying all thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects which are naturally due from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:204181:322"/>to the author of their being, and which we cannot but owe to thoſe who are of the ſame kind with us? What is it that hath ſo perverted the underſtanding of Chriſtian People, as to poſſeſs them with apprehenſions quite contrary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon? What ailes us that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the end of Chriſt's coming, nay, that we overlook the plain words of his holy Scriptures, which tell us, that he <hi>left us an example,</hi> and expects that we ſhould <hi>follow</hi> it, and be <hi>made conformable</hi> to him, and be <hi>renewed after his image,</hi> in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and true holineſs; <hi>without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord?</hi> This the Bloud (5.) ſpeaks ſtill more effectually. For he would dye rather than diſobey God. <hi>He became obedient to death, even the death of the Croſs,</hi> ii. Philip. 8. which was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why God ſo highly exalted him, and gave him that Name which he hath above every Name. There was no other way whereby he could aſcend up into Glory: And therefore it is madneſs for us to think to leap up thither, and skip over the holy life of Jeſus. Eſpecially ſince he declares, that his Bloud was ſhed (to which perhaps we truſt for redemption, though we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in our impurities) <hi>that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from all iniquity, and purifie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:204181:323"/>a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> ii. Tit. 14. To the doing of which (6.) he hath given us the <hi>Spirit</hi> for our helper. Every Miracle that it wrought (to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is within the verge of theſe words) bids us conſider what a Potent Lord we ſerve: for whom nothing is too hard. By a Thouſand Wonders, by more miraculous works than we could have had time to read, ſhould they have been all written, did he awake the ſleepy World: commanding them to ariſe, and go about his work; and he would be with them, his Power, which nothing can withſtand, ſhould aid and ſuccour them. The obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, me thinks, which the Winds and the Sea, and the Fiſhes, and the Graves, and the Devils themſelves paid him, call upon us and tell us both what we ought to do, and what aſſiſtance we may expect from the power of his might to make us obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his Faith. Who can reſiſt the joynt importunity of ſo many Witneſſes? who can hear all theſe tell us, that <hi>the Son-of-God is come,</hi> by whom we muſt be governed, and yet be ſo ſenſeleſly obſtinate, as to ſay, <hi>We will not have this man to rule over us?</hi> O deaf ears! O hearts harder than the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Milſtone! which will not let ſuch loud voices ſink into them; ſuch mighty
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:204181:323"/>arguments penetrate and mollifie them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to compliance with him! What can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch Souls and bring them under any government, who will not be reclaimed by the authority of the Son of God? I may <hi>call Heaven and Earth to Witneſs,</hi> againſt ſuch obdurate hearts. The Father, Word and Holy Ghoſt, theſe are Witneſſes in Heaven, that teſtifie it is our duty and intereſt too to ſubmit our ſelves unto him. The Water, Bloud, and the Spirit, they are Witneſſes on Earth, which agree together to perſwade us to take his eaſie Yoke upon us. Can neither Heaven nor Earth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us? Is not <hi>God the Father</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty great enough to lay his commands upon us? Is the <hi>WORD</hi> of God of leſs credit, than the common vogue and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World, with us? Cannot the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> be believed concerning the place from whence it comes, when it ſays that no unclean thing ſhall enter in thither? Do we think his <hi>holy life</hi> to be a troubleſome folly? and deſpiſe his <hi>bloud?</hi> and reſiſt his <hi>ſpirit?</hi> and receive all the grace of God in vain? <hi>Hear, O Heavens, and give ear, O Earth;</hi> after God had ſent many of his Servants who were diſregarded. He laſt of all ſent his Son into the World, ſaying, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>they will reverence my Son;</hi> but they have rebelled againſt him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="622" facs="tcp:204181:324"/>I might call for Hell it ſelf to witneſs againſt ſuch perverſe and diſloyal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The Devils will not fail to accuſe ſuch men hereafter: for <hi>they believe and tremble;</hi> they acknowledge this great Truth, that <hi>Jeſus is the Holy one of God</hi> (iv. <hi>Luke</hi> 34.) which is the very ſame that <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf ſaid, when he tells us <hi>the Father hath ſanctified him</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> made him his holy One) <hi>and ſent him into the world,</hi> x. <hi>John</hi> 36. And that is more, I doubt, than a great many irreligious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits will confeſs; in their works, I am ſure, the moſt of the Chriſtian world ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny it. Do you think the Devils who made that confeſſion would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed him, if they might have taken our place, and had his Salvation offered to them? Would they not have ſhaken off their chains, and taken upon them his yoke, had they received ſuch gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations as he hath made to us? Let us not be worſe than they, I beſeech you, by caſting away that hope, which was never given them; and ſlighting ſuch tenders of mercy which are peculiarly directed to the children of men. But let us rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, adore and magnifie this amazing love of God, who ſent his Son ſo kindly to
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:204181:324"/>ſpeak to ſuch wretches as we are. And let us ſhow that we are ſenſible of his love, by hearkening to his voice, and readily ſubmitting our ſelves with all dutiful, nay joyful affection to his commands. <hi>See,</hi> I beſeech you again, <hi>that you refuſe not him that ſpeaketh: for if they eſcaped not who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed him that ſpake on Earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from Heaven.</hi> Let all his Laws be held moſt ſacred, and be devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reverenced and obſerved. Know that this is <hi>your wiſdom and underſtanding;</hi> nay, remember that it is <hi>your life. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keep your Souls diligently, leſt you forget thoſe things which you have heard, and leſt they depart from your hearts all the days of your life.</hi> Chuſe death rather than the life of the <hi>unrighteous, fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, thieves, covetous, drunkards, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers, and extortioners, who,</hi> he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Do you not remember how obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant the children of <hi>Jonadab</hi> the ſon of <hi>Rechab</hi> were of their Fathers Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and how they could not be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, no not by a Prophet, to contradict it? xxxv. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. What Arguments I pray you had they (ſo reaſonable and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as thoſe which urge us) for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction?
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:204181:325"/>Might they not have ſlipt many ways, with better colour than we can do, from this obligation? Did there want plauſible pretences to plead their excuſe, if they had abſolved themſelves and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it? Might they not have ſaid that every Creature of God was good, and none to be refuſed? That their ſtomachs ſometimes required a little Wine, and that it was reaſonable to give them ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? That their Father had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his Authority, and taken away the juſt liberty which God had left them? That they were reſtrained enough by the Divine Laws, and that there needed no more of his making? O the inſenſibleneſs and ingratitude of Chriſtian people, that can think of theſe mens reverence to ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and hard a command of their Father, and be leſs obedient to their moſt gracious Lord! What a forehead hath that man who dares venture to break any of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, when he hath ſo many Reaſons to believe that he hath laid none upon us, but thoſe which are the very mind and will of God; and are ſuch a neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable burden, that unleſs we carry them we cannot be ſaved? There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can be pretended, why we ſhould not ſtrictly tye our ſelves to his will.
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:204181:325"/>Not only the love, which engaged the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites,</hi> enforces our obedience, but infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more reaſon than there was in their Fathers will and pleaſure; for we are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Son of God. He could not but have a perfect underſtanding of what was fit and convenient for us. If there had been any other way more eaſie to Heaven, than this he hath ſet before us, we cannot but think He would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it unto us. If there were any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe that could be granted us, to diſpenſe with our obedience, He was not ſo unkind as to conceal it: much leſs would he have taken it upon his death, that none will be allowed. For he declared openly in his Sermons, that he will not only take no knowledge of thoſe who work iniquity, but bid them depart from him, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever relation they pretend to him. And by his Bloud he aſſures us that he preached nothing but the undoubted Truth of God. What is it then, that makes men ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, either to ſlight all that he ſays, or to give him the lye? It is no better, if we preſume to believe that we ſhall ſhift well enough in another world, though we do what we liſt while we are here. It is to contradict the voice of the Father, of the Word, and of the Holy Ghoſt. It is to
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:204181:326"/>oppoſe the Doctrine, the Life, the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Power and Spirit of the Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> who all tell us that we muſt be holy and unblameable before him in love, if we hope to be accepted with him. They that live wickedly and yet hope well, do in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſay that He is a Lyar, and that there is no ſuch neceſſity of holineſs, without which, he ſays, no man ſhall ſee the Lord. Or elſe they deſpiſe that bleſſed ſight, which is as bad, and neither dread his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, nor deſire his favour. If they be believers, then they reproach him by their wicked lives, as if he were ſtill dead, and could do no more to make his diſciples better, or to reward and puniſh their good or bad behaviour, than <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> can, or any other impoſtor. All the Oaths, curſes and blaſphemies which we hear out of Chriſtian mouths, are as ſo many ſpears to pierce our Saviour again, becauſe they forely wound his Religion, and tend to the deſtruction of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Government. All the laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, wantonneſs, and filthy debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that are among us, are a kind of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying <hi>Jeſus</hi> afreſh; they are a ſcoff and mock at his Croſs, as a ridiculous piece of folly. They reproach him as if he were an ideot, that did not underſtand pleaſure,
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:204181:326"/>but would put himſelf to unneceſſary pain and trouble. Nor can we put a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter interpretation upon mens eager purſuit of riches and honours, in unjuſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable and irreligious ways, which charges him with great ignorance, to ſay no worſe, who took the quite contrary courſe to happineſs. As for all thoſe who gibe at his Religion, and make themſelves ſport with the Hiſtory of his Birth and of his Sufferings, they come under another rank, being open and profeſſed Enemies to his Majeſty. They do as much as in them lies to hang him upon the Gibbet again, and expoſe him to the ſcorn of the world. They juſtifie the <hi>Jews</hi> in their calumnies and blaſphemies, and take part with <hi>Judas,</hi> or rather are worſe than He, who was tempted only by his covetouſneſs to betray him. And better it had been for theſe men, if they never had been born. It were better for them that a milſtone were hang'd about their neck, and they were caſt into the Sea, or that they had been hang'd themſelves on a Gallows as high as that of <hi>Haman,</hi> than that they ſhould live thus to expoſe the Saviour of the world to ſhame. For though he will not die and riſe again to convince them, yet he will come and appear again to condemn them. <hi>He
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:204181:327"/>will be revealed from Heaven in flaming fire, taking vengeance of all them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord</hi> Jeſus <hi>Chriſt: who ſhall be puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> i. 8, 9. Let us therefore take good heed to our ſelves, that we be neither faithleſs, nor unfaithful to our belief. But let us ſettle ſuch an unmoveable faith in our Souls, upon theſe ſtrong foundations which God hath laid for it, and let us ſo ſtir it up by new reflections every day on what we believe, that we may have our portion among thoſe who are ſpoken of in the next words, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>When he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.</hi>

                        <p>But ſome perhaps will pretend, that there are ſo many things to hinder every man from doing his duty, that though he believe never ſo well, and think obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence never ſo neceſſary, yet he ſhall never be able to comply with the commands of the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but muſt be forced to break them, even after he hath reſolved the contrary. To this S. <hi>John</hi> hath here alſo taken care to give us an anſwer, when he tells us that ſuch is the power of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:204181:327"/>Faith, that by it we OVERCOME THE WORLD, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>For whatſoever is born of God, OVERCOMETH THE WORLD: and this is the victory that OVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COMETH THE WORLD, even our faith. Who is he that OVERCOMETH THE WORLD, but he that believeth that</hi> Jeſus <hi>is the Son of God.</hi>

                        <p>That is the next thing therefore which I am to give a brief account of, that our Lord expects (which he would not do, if he did not endue us with ſufficient ſtrength) that in the vertue of this Belief, we ſhould get the better of all temptations which ſtand in the way of our duty, and would hinder us from the performance of it. By the WORLD, with which we are to conflict till we overcome, is partly underſtood <hi>wicked men,</hi> xv. <hi>John</hi> 18. partly the <hi>tribulations</hi> and miſeries we may here endure by their and other means, xvi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 33. and partly the <hi>allurements</hi> and enticing enjoyments, wherewith all our ſenſes are entertained, 1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 15, 16. All theſe oppoſe us, and ſet themſelves againſt us, either by diſcouraging or elſe flattering us from our known duty. It is hard to be the
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:204181:328"/>object of hatred, contempt or ſcorn; har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to endure alſo poverty, hunger, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and ſuch torments as the Apoſtles and other bleſſed Martyrs ſuffered; and perhaps hardeſt of all to reſiſt the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of pleaſure, which proſperity and wordly Glory bring along with them. What muſt a Believer do, when he is thus beſet? Muſt he be content to yield himſelf too weak to deal with theſe enemies? Muſt he let the WORLD have the day, and declare that it was impoſſible to ſtand againſt its mighty forces? Or will it be ſufficient to enter into a conflict with them, if it be but to ſay that he was not falſe or cowardly, though he ſuffer himſelf to be over-powred by them? No, the Faith of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſtronger than ſo, if it be deeply rooted in our hearts: and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to maſter all theſe, which ſeem to be no equal match for us. Their ſtrength lies only in the weakneſs of our Faith. If we <hi>stand faſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>in the faith grounded and ſetled, and be not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel,</hi> they will loſe their force and flee before us, and leave us victorious. Theſe ſix <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are ſuch Champions, if I may ſo call them, that the Faith which is led by them, and firmly relies upon them, cannot come off baſely, but muſt needs be triumphant.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="631" facs="tcp:204181:328"/>1. As for the hatred of men and their deſpiſal, alas! what a contemptible thing does it ſeem? how does it ſneak into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when we look up unto <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and remember that He was the Son of God, and yet endured it (as he tells his Apoſtles, xv. <hi>John</hi> 18.) and thought himſelf never the leſs glorious? It cannot be help'd but we muſt be ſcorned ſometime or other, if we will follow him; unleſs we could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade all men to bear us company. But this is our comfort and encouragement, that this is the way to glory, and that now we are conformed to our Saviour, who by the ſhame of the Croſs, hath got himſelf immortal honour; and that the <hi>Father</hi> at preſent approves us, the <hi>Word</hi> delights in us, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God and of Glory reſts upon us; all theſe Heavenly Witneſſes eſteem and love us, and are pleaſed to ſee us behave our ſelves worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>Jeſus</hi> did.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And if from hence we paſs through many tribulations, and encounter ſuch troubles and hardſhips as we are all deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to avoid, they will not be able to affright or daunt him who hath this faith thus planted in his heart; <hi>For greater is
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:204181:329"/>He that is in us, than he that is in the WORLD.</hi> Did not the ancient Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies and great Warriers againſt the WORLD, wade through very great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the ſtrength of a Faith which was much weaker than this of ours? How did all thoſe brave men whom you read of, <hi>Hebr.</hi> xi. <hi>obtain a good report,</hi> but <hi>through faith,</hi> when it had not received this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? <hi>ver.</hi> 39. Surely, we that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand more than they did, we who <hi>know the Son of God is come,</hi> not only by <hi>WA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER,</hi> but by <hi>BLOUD;</hi> and who know that Eternal life is in him, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Holy Ghoſt, and are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of ſuch glorious Revelations in the Goſpel of his grace, and who know the certainty of thoſe things wherein we are inſtructed; we, I ſay, cannot but take the courage in the power of ſuch a Faith to behave our ſelves valiantly, and with Chriſtian reſolution, in ſuch like ſtraits and dangers as made their fidelity ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. Read what S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us, 1 iii. 14, 15. <hi>But if you ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake, happy are ye; and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled. But ſanctifie the Lord God in your hearts; and be ready always to give an anſwer to every man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:204181:329"/>you.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, It may ſeem a ſtrange folly to ſuffer ſo much as you do, and you may begin to be ſtartled at the troubles which befall you; but bear a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend regard towards God who hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you to this ſtate of Chriſtianity, do but ſtand in awe of his Authority who hath bid you hear, that is obey, Jeſus whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſt you; and do but tell every Man what reaſon you have for what you do and ſuffer, and what hope you have in him upon this account: And then they will either ceaſe to trouble you, or you will ceaſe to be troubled for what they make you ſuffer. Now what are the reaſons of our Chriſtian hope and patience, but theſe which we are here treating of? If we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge theſe to our ſelves or to others, it will ſoon appear that we are no fools in expoſing our ſelves to any dangers for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſake. The <hi>Father</hi> hath bidden us be true to it, ſo hath the <hi>Word</hi> and ſo hath the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> every one of the other three alſo call upon us to be couragious; for it is a worthy cauſe wherein we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and we ſhall not loſe our reward. Here are reaſons enough; and they are ſtronger than all their adverſaries. The World hath nothing to oppoſe ſo weighty as theſe Witneſſes; every one of which I
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:204181:330"/>might ſhow you (if it would not prove too tedious) lay an obligation on us not to be moved from our ſtedfaſtneſs, but to take up our Croſs and to follow Jeſus. And I the rather paſs by theſe, becauſe I think they are generally of leſs force than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the <hi>WORLD,</hi> which uſes to aſſault Mankind more dangerouſly.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. I mean the alluring and inticing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments here below, which we are too prone to comply withall. They are of an inveigling and inſinuating nature, and may get admittance by their ſoft violence; when the other cannot prevail by more rough oppoſition. We are apt to fortifie our ſelves againſt evil things, and are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times angry they ſhould attempt to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter us; but to the good things of the <hi>WORLD</hi> we lye naked and open, and there is a treacherous party within that is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they ſhould enter, nay, ready to open the doors to them. And they are of three ſorts, as the forenamed place in this Epiſtle tells us, <hi>the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life,</hi> ii. 16. All that the <hi>WORLD</hi> contains in it, for the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating of an earthly Mans affections, and ſatisfying his deſires is comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one of theſe three Names. For the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:204181:330"/>of which you muſt know, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> have a manner of ſpeech which expreſſes the <hi>Object</hi> by the <hi>Act:</hi> and the cleareſt interpretation of theſe words is grounded on that uſe of theirs. So that by <hi>LUST</hi> we are to underſtand all thoſe things that gratifie ſome appetite of pleaſure, wealth, or greatneſs; and by <hi>FLESH</hi> (which is not here, as it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a general word) it is moſt agreeable to underſtand the lower and duller ſenſes which lye moſt in the fleſh, and are affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with things that have ſome groſneſs in them. And then the whole phraſe, <hi>LUST OF THE FLESH,</hi> that ſort of things which give content to the touch, the taſte and ſmell; ſuch as are meat, and drink and perfumes, and other voluptuous enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, I need not name but, are ſometimes particularly called <hi>FLESH.</hi> And then by the <hi>LUST OF THE EYES,</hi> we are to underſtand ſuch things, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the higher and more renned ſenſe of ſeeing, <hi>viz.</hi> Gold and Silver, precious Stones and Jewels, Lordſhips and large poſſeſſions, noble Houſes and rich Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, beautiful Pictures and fair Gardens, fine clothes and coſtly attire; all that is comprehended under the name of <hi>Riches,</hi> which as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, yields only this
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:204181:331"/>ſatisfaction to the owner, that <hi>he beholdeth them with his eye.</hi> There is little in theſe things but what is all lodged in this ſenſe; and therefore they are called the <hi>luſt of the eye,</hi> becauſe it loves to look upon them, and when that is done, they can do more for him. Only they may prefer a man to that which he calls the <hi>PRIDE OF LIFE;</hi> which ſignifies all thoſe things that flatter and pleaſe the inward ſenſe, our fancy or imagination. Such as are great offices and places of Dignity, noble Titles, all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory of the World, together with the eſteem, at leaſt the applauſe and commendation of men, which is wont to follow them.</p>
                        <p>One or more of theſe <hi>three</hi> ſorts of things every man naturally hunts after, and his deſires prick him forward in its purſuit. For theſe are mens ſtudy and labour; with theſe the Devil baits his hooks, to catch Souls, and they who do not bite at one will be nibling at another. They that are not tempted by the firſt to gluttony and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, fornication and ſuch like filthineſs, feel the ſecond perhaps incline them to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs and the ſordid love of Money, with a thirſt and greedineſs of another kind. Or if they can eſcape and deſpiſe
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:204181:331"/>theſe, they may notwithſtanding be in danger to be carried away with the humor of prodigality, and affectation of vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ambition of Dignities; which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with emulation, envy and other dangerous Vices. As the <hi>African</hi> Beaſt which ſome write of, is caught with Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and ſuffers its feet to be fettered while it liſtens to the Leſſons that are play'd to it: So do the generality of Mankind let their Souls be inſnared and led into a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable captivity, by the inchanting voice of pleaſure, riches, or glory. Whilſt they hearken to the bewitching melody which ſome of theſe court them withall, they are taken in the mighty Hunter's net, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a prey to him that lurks for Souls, and ſeek whom he may devour. And it has not been in the power of the wiſeſt Charmers that ever were in the World, to open the eares of the moſt of men, and to convey the ſenſe of better things into them. All the Philoſophy and Learning that was ſo famous in former Ages, could never obtain ſuch numerous chearful and obedient Auditors, as the Syren Songs, which theſe three ſing in Mens cares, have always ſound. When the World there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by that wiſdome knew not God, <hi>it pleaſed God,</hi> ſays S. <hi>Paul</hi> (1 Cor. i. 21.)
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:204181:332"/>
                           <hi>by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe.</hi> The faith of Chriſt directs and diſpoſes us to avoid all thoſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rocks on which they ſplit themſelves who liſten to thoſe deceitful Songs. Now that the Son of God is come, He pulls our feet out of the net; and by his far more powerful charms ſo ſtops our ears to thoſe inchantments, that there is no entrance for them any more. It ſeemed a fooliſh thing indeed to the World, to believe that the crucified Jeſus was the Son of God; but where this ſimple faith prevailed it did more, than all the wiſdome of the World was able to effect before. For it gave them a new underſtanding and ſaved them from periſhing; by making them account it the greateſt pleaſure and glory and treaſures to follow Jeſus, and do the will of God, as he did. <hi>The World,</hi> they ſaw, <hi>paſſeth away and the luſt thereof</hi> (if they do not leave us, we muſt at laſt leave them) <hi>but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.</hi> So thoſe <hi>three</hi> Heavenly witneſſes, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> aſſure us: whoſe voice as it is moſt ſweet and melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, ſo it is moſt powerful to diſinchant us, and to preſerve thoſe who receive their teſtimony, from all the bewitching tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of thoſe other <hi>three,</hi> the <hi>luſt of the
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:204181:332"/>fleſh,</hi> the <hi>luſt of the eye</hi> and <hi>the pride of life.</hi> Nay, here are two <hi>Threes</hi> of infinitely greater vertue and efficacy to prevail with us, than all that the <hi>WORLD'S Trinity</hi> can offer to us, if we will but open our ears, and diligently liſten to their voice.</p>
                        <p>And how can we chooſe but liſten when the <hi>Father</hi> of Heaven calls to us ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, when the <hi>Word</hi> opens his ſecrets to us, and the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> proclaims ſuch an abundant love of God towards us: The <hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>Bloud,</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> they alſo with one conſent conſpire with thoſe, and all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſing this <hi>New Song, THE SON OF GOD IS COME, the Son of God is come.</hi> This one note of theirs more raviſhes, than all the pleaſures and ſatisfactions which the <hi>WORLD</hi> infatuates its followers withall. Heaven and Earth cannot ſpeak any thing more moving in our ears than this, which again and again ſalutes them with new joy. For what would you have them ſay? would it pleaſe you to hear that Infinite Goodneſs loves us, that the Heavens ſtand open to us, and ſhow us their glory, that God is willing to receive us up thither, that he will make us Heirs of a Kingdom, equal with the Angels, to hear their Songs, and joyn with that Celeſtial Quire? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold!
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:204181:333"/>they are all included in this one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, THE SON OF GOD IS COME. GOD HATH GIVEN US HIS SON. This is the ſweeteſt Aire that can touch our eares: this we can never be weary to hear: this ſtrikes our ſouls, if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, ſo gratefully, that we cannot but ſay, let us hear that again. And therefore after the Father, the Word, and the Holy-Ghoſt have bleſt our ears with this <hi>joyful ſound;</hi> here are <hi>three</hi> more that take it up, and repeat it to us with the ſtrongeſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, that we hear the Voice of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And the oftner we liſten to them and lend them our attention (the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, I mean, we think upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we have to believe in Jeſus) the more deaf ſhall we grow to all the ſinful allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this World, how inviting ſoever before they have been. For my part, I think there is more real ſatisfaction in the very underſtanding of this one place of Holy Scripture, than in all the delights of worldly men. What is there, I beſeech you conſider, in all their ſenſualities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the rational guſt of what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that one voice of the Father, THIS IS MY WELL BELOVED SON, IN WHOM I AM WELL PLEASED? What Riches are there to be equalled with
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:204181:333"/>this treaſure of Divine knowledge, that God hath beſtowed his own Son upon us? What honour like to this, to be preferred to be the Friends, yea the Sons of God? Can you hear any thing ſo delicious as that voice of the WORD, <hi>To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, will I give to eat of the tree of life, in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God?</hi> ii. Rev. 7. Were there ever any Jewels ſo precious, as the ineſtimable gifts, wherewithall the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath inriched the Church? what Muſick is there fit to bear a part, with thoſe <hi>Hymns, and Pſalms, and ſpiritual Songs,</hi> that it inſpired the hearts of Chriſtians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? Doth it not even raviſh the heart of a pious man to think of them, though he do not hear the like in theſe days? What is there in all the broken Ciſterns of this World, that taſtes like the <hi>Rivers of living Water,</hi> that Jeſus hath poured out unto us? What peace does it ſpeak to us, like that which by the <hi>Bloud</hi> of Jeſus is purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for us? Or what power is there in any of this Worlds temptation, that can ſtand before the voice of that SPIRIT which ſays <hi>COME, and whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely?</hi> xxii. Rev. 17. Certainly, in the ſtrength of ſuch a faith ſo fortified, ſo incouraged by all theſe <hi>Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> we may eaſily tread the WORLD
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:204181:334"/>under our feet, and make its moſt migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty temptations crouch to us; whereas now, for want of this ſolid faith we ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bow down to it and worſhip it. Let but any man remember when he reads theſe words, <hi>LOVE NOT THE WORLD; for all that is in the WORLD, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the World. And the world paſſeth away and the luſt thereof; but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.</hi> Or when he reads any other leſſon in the holy Books, let him but remember, that thus ſays the <hi>Father</hi> of all, and thus ſays his WORD, and this is the voice of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and of all the reſt of the Witneſſes, who teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that <hi>Jeſus</hi> who teaches theſe things is the <hi>Son of God;</hi> and then he will never be perſwaded to yield to the faireſt thing that ever eye beheld, or the ſweeteſt thing the mouth can taſte, or the greateſt pleaſure any other ſenſe is capable to feel, if it muſt be enjoyed by the breaking of any of theſe commandments. No, he will <hi>yield himſelf unto God,</hi> (vi. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.) and lay himſelf at the feet of his <hi>WORD,</hi> and ſubmit to the dictates and ſentence of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and follow the example of Chriſt's <hi>purity,</hi> and be made
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:204181:334"/>conformable to his <hi>Death,</hi> and be led by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and think it an honour to be conquered by ſuch Defendants of the cauſe of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> O how hateful would every ſin be to us, though it dreſs up it ſelf never ſo beautifully, and court us with never ſuch promiſes of pleaſure or greatneſs, did we but at the ſame time reflect upon theſe Witneſſes and remember what they have teſtified to us! How ſhould we deſire it? How paſſionately ſhould we tear all its gaudy dreſſes in pieces? How heartily ſhould we deſpiſe all its temptations, which would have us ſlight all theſe great <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> who tell us the <hi>Son of God is come,</hi> and that he is come for this purpoſe, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil? 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 8. Every unlawful enjoyment would look like a manifeſt jeer to all theſe, and as if a man ſhould ſay to them, Why do you trouble your ſelves, this is our Darling, our God, and all your perſwaſions ſhall not prevail with us to let it go. It would appear a contempt of God; a laughing of his WORD to ſcorn, who came upon ſo needleſs, at leaſt fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs an errand; a manifeſt challenge to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who by every ſin is boldly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. And what heart can endure to think of being guilty of ſuch madneſs?
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:204181:335"/>which throws dirt into this <hi>pure Water,</hi> I mean the life of Chriſt, and treads his <hi>Bloud</hi> under feet, and miſcalls the <hi>Spirit</hi> of grace, as if it were not <hi>the Truth,</hi> but had deceived the world when it told them, that <hi>this is the will of God, even our ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For God</hi> (ſays S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>hath not called us unto uncleanneſs, but unto holineſs. He therefore that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not Man but God, who hath alſo given unto us his holy SPIRIT,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> iv. 3, 7, 8.</p>
                        <p>To conclude this, you know what is commonly ſaid, and it is a certain truth, of thoſe who are bit with a kind of Spider in <hi>Italy,</hi> which they call a <hi>Tarantula,</hi> that there is no way to cure them of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant frenzy, but by ſuch Muſick as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to the motions which their poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon makes in the brain of him, into whom it is infuſed. Let this be an Emblem of the truth I have now delivered; that the old Serpent having envenomed mens Souls, poiſoned their principles, pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their affections, and depraved their lives; there is nothing of efficacy ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to recover them, but only ſuch charms as theſe, which by this <hi>ſix stringed</hi> Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I may call it, God hath provided for our Cure. And this will certainly do
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:204181:335"/>it, by infuſing the Faith of <hi>Jeſus</hi> into us, which is the victory whereby we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the WORLD. Do but hearken diligently to theſe Witneſſes, do but mind their ſweet conſent, their harmony and agreement in the teſtimony they give to this great truth, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> our Maſter is the Son of God; and there is no venome ſo deadly which this Faith will not expel, no love to the WORLD ſo ſtrong which it will not vanquiſh and ſubdue. It will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover us to our ſelves, and make nothing ſeem ſo ridiculous as the folly and frantick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of worldly men; yet it will advance us to a Divine and Heavenly ſpirit, ſo that we ſhall not be apt to receive ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent infuſions any more, but <hi>keep our ſelves in the love of God, looking for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life.</hi>

                        <p>For I muſt add now, in the laſt place, that this Faith is ſo far from being unable to conquer all temptations which would hinder us from obeying our Saviour's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that it gives us power and ſtrength to do our duty <hi>with chearfulneſs.</hi> So S. <hi>John</hi> here tells us, when he adds to what he ſays of the keeping of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:204181:336"/>that HIS COMMAND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS ARE NOT GRIEVOUS. For (as <hi>Oecumenius</hi> well gloſſes) what load is it for a man to love his Brother? What great burden is it to viſit him if he be in priſon? God doth not command thee to deliver him, but only to viſit him. He doth not bid thee knock off his chains, but ſee how he bears them. Nor doth he bid thee cure a ſick man, but only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and relieve him. Nor provide dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for a poor man, but only feed him; nor give rich apparel to the naked, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloath them. And ſo we may conclude of the reſt, that it is rather an eaſe than a burden to be ſober and chaſte in all enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of pleaſure; to be content with a ſmall portion of thoſe things, which others deſire with a greedy and ravenous eye; to bear with that patiently which we cannot remedy; to be careful for nothing, but in every thing to make known our requeſts to God with Prayer and Thankſgiving; to be meek and peaceable amongſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious people; to forgive thoſe that injure us; to envy no man's greatneſs; and with an humble modeſty, to ſatisfie our ſelves though we be not equal to them. Theſe and ſuch like qualities wherewith <hi>Jeſus</hi> would inveſt us, are in themſelves moſt
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:204181:336"/>deſirable; and, though richer than cloath of Gold, are like our ordinary garments, which are no load to thoſe that wear them. But they are the leſs grievous to thoſe that believe in <hi>Jeſus;</hi> who are endued with power from above, by receiving the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſo many Divine Witneſſes, who aſſure them they are in the way of God, in the company of his Son, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Holy Ghoſt, in the direct rode to that glorious place where <hi>Jeſus</hi> is; and therefore why ſhould not they rejoyce and be exceeding glad to find themſelves thus happy? That load which to a ſick man ſeems intolerable, if it be laid on the neck of one in health is ſo eaſie, that he can run away with it with pleaſure. And ſo it is in the caſe of keeping God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which to a man that has ſpoil'd his Soul by following divers luſts, are ſo far from being eaſie, that he thinks them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable and impoſſible to be complied withall; but when he has recovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the faith of Chriſt, and hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſupply of theſe new and Heavenly principles, they become to the very ſame man, not only tolerable, but ſweet and delightful. This faith would not be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be excuſed from this burden; it would take it ill not to draw in the ſame
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:204181:337"/>Yoke with <hi>Jeſus;</hi> it naturally makes us of his Spirit, who ſaid, <hi>I delight to do thy will, O God.</hi> For what is it that we believe? Is it not that <hi>Jeſus is the Son of God;</hi> his well-beloved Son? And ſhall we complain of that work, which was the buſineſs and the delight of God's beſt beloved, when he was in the world? It would be too grievous an accuſation of God, to think that after he had filled the Earth with joy and gladneſs for the coming of his Son, He ſhould inſtantly quench it all, and turn it into heavineſs, by a number of ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and intolerable Commandments, as no man can look upon and not be melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. And what are the grounds of our belief? Are they not all that Heaven and Earth can afford us? Are we not as ſure as God can make us? Phy! for ſhame then, what a reproach is it, that any man ſhould ſigh and groan, look four and ſad, as if he had all the burden of Heaven and Earth to carry, when he has rather the aid and aſſiſtance of both to ſupport and ſtrengthen him under an eaſie load?</p>
                        <p>Certain it is, that according to our knowledge and underſtanding, ſo will be our Faith: and according to our faith, ſo will be our ſtrength. Now how can there
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:204181:337"/>be greater evidence and ſtrength of Reaſon to induce us to believe than theſe <hi>ſix Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> have given us? They fully ſatisfie our underſtandings; they make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely rational to acknowledge <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the Son of God. And therefore why ſhould not this Faith, thus begot and ſtanding on ſuch ſure foundations, give us a very great ſtrength, courage, chearfulneſs and ſpirit; making difficult things become eaſie, harſh things become ſweet, and the moſt tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtay in this world comfortable, by preſenting us, and that ſo ſtrongly, with the power and glory of the Lord <hi>Jeſus?</hi> This Faith you ſee reſts upon theſe ſix Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, upon theſe two rows of Pillars (as I may ſo ſpeak) on the one ſide ſtands the teſtimony of the FATHER, the WORD, and the HOLY GHOST; on the other ſide, the teſtimony of the WATER, the BLOUD, and the SPIRIT: and therefore nothing will be too great a burden to lay upon it; it will ſupport any weight, and never let us groan, much leſs break under its load. <hi>All things are EAST</hi> as well as <hi>POSSIBLE to him that believeth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is the obſervation of <hi>Seneca,</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that nothing is ſo hard but the mind of man can maſter it, and make it familiar, by conſtant thoughts and pains about it.
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:204181:338"/>There are no motions ſo natural, but ſome by labour have reſtrained them, and made the forbearance of them eaſie: and none again ſo unnatural but by the like daily practice and attention they have brought themſelves to the delightful uſe of them. As ſome have kept long and tedious faſts, others perpetual ſilence, and have lived out of the company of all mankind, which are examples of the former kind. And we ſee inſtances of the latter, in thoſe who learn to walk and dance upon ropes, to work with their feet, and to dive into the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive depths of the Sea. And can the mind of man alone, when it buckles it ſelf to the buſineſs, be able to perform ſuch difficult things with eaſe and ſatisfaction; and yet remain utterly unable to take any content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in obedience to Chriſt's Precepts, though it be exalted by faith, and a faith ſo ſtrong, as theſe ſix Witneſſes, if we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, will work in us? May things to which nature is not inclined be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed at laſt, and become habitual, and we think God too ſevere to expect from us thoſe duties which are moſt agreeable to our natures, as all the actions of vertue are? And ſhall a weaker power maſter thoſe hard and unnatural tasks, and a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtronger than all others ſink under the
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:204181:338"/>burden of the moſt reaſonable, and, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, moſt natural Commandments? It cannot but put a conſidering perſon into a little indignation, to hear men complain of the uneaſineſs of Chriſt's yoke, when they lay more troubleſome and unmerciful burdens upon themſelves, without any murmuring. How can one ſee men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome impatience, contend with ſwift horſes, and endeavour to out-run them, and yet cry out of the tediouſneſs of the race of God's Commandments? Shall any man perſwade us, that it is not ſo eaſie to learn the way of God's teſtimonies, as it is to work with his feet, or go upon his hands? Shall they make us believe it is ſo hard a buſineſs to bend their wills to God's, when we ſee their bodies made as ſupple as wax, that they may wreath them about at pleaſure? Can it be half ſo troubleſome to lay a bridle on our tongues, as it is never to ſpeak at all? O man! where is thy Reaſon, what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thy Soul, that thou groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the ſervice of God, and canſt make a ſport of far more grievous things? Thy own mind might teach thee better, if thou wouldſt but hearken to its inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and therefore what may not God expect from the Faith I am ſpeaking of,
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:204181:339"/>which is a far more powerful Principle, and hath made Men <hi>stop the mouths of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, quench the violence of Fire, indure tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and not accept deliverance,</hi> when it was much weaker than our faith need now be? I will ingage that if a man do but uſe himſelf frequently to ponder theſe words of S. <hi>John,</hi> and perſwade himſelf fully, upon the teſtimony of theſe Witneſſes that Jeſus is the Son of God, He will account it a ſmall buſineſs to deny his own will as Jeſus did. He will never complain that he muſt refrain from any thing in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him; and whatſoever he requires him to do, he will eſteem it an exceſſive pleaſure. For there can remain no doubt in his mind, that if he be the Son of God, he hath power to help us &amp; that he wil ever be aſſiſtant to us and bleſs us; becauſe by this faith he dwelleth in us and we in him.</p>
                        <p>I have read of one, of a Noble Family, delicately educated, and of a tender health, who had a great mind to enter upon a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious courſe of life (as they ſpeak in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church) but was afrighted out of thoſe thoughts by the apparent difficulty of the exerciſes wherein he was to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; for their ill diet, retirement, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, watchings and ſuch like hardſhips
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:204181:339"/>he imagined could not be endured. Till one day reading thoſe words of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, which like a flaſh of lightning ſtruck into his mind (xviii. Pſal. 33. <hi>He maketh my feet like Hindes feet, and ſetteth me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my high places</hi> (which he expounded to this ſenſe, God will inable me with ſpeed and eaſineſs to run, not only upon the even ground and over the plains, but in craggy and ſteep places; he will lead me not only upon the level, but aſſiſt me to climb Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and to overtop the higheſt difficulties that are in my way to Heaven and) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately he found all his fears vaniſh, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions determined, and ſuch a courage put into him, that from this time forward he was immoveably bent to that formerly dreadful kind of life. Would not this word of God then, think you, which I have expounded, inſpire us with as manly a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and greatneſs of mind to obey God's unqueſtionable commands, if we did but ſuffer it to penetrate into our hearts? Did we but conceive that we heard the Father ſay to us perpetually, <hi>This is my Son,</hi> This that came by <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Bloud,</hi> that climbed even the croſs it ſelf that ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the higheſt difficulties, He is my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son; and if we thought we heard the WORD ſay, the <hi>Son of God is come, God is
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:204181:340"/>manifeſted in the fleſh;</hi> and felt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> inſpiring him with the ſame heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts; the whole glorious <hi>Trinity</hi> telling us, they will aſſiſt us, and afford us their continual help; it could not but give wings, as I may ſay, to our feet, and make us skip over the moſt mountainous diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and run the ways of God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and not be tired; that we might follow after, and go to the bleſſed Jeſus. For the courſe of life which that Gentleman affected, was that of a Religious Order (as they call it) where they are tied to do more than God commands, to live by a Rule ſtricter than the Goſpel, and under the Will of a Superiour, whom they are bound to obey, as if he were Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And it was not the literal ſenſe of the place neither which thus animated him, and put it into his heart to undergo ſuch a ſervitude. And therefore if he did the will of men ſo chearfully, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took more than God requires of us, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a weaker perſwaſion, by accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſenſe of an holy word to his own preſent thoughts; there is no doubt but a right faith would indue us with the like power (notwithſtanding the appearance of great labours) in the true ſervice of God, in obedience to his indiſpenſable commands:
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:204181:340"/>we having this word of God to ſtrengthen our faith, the prime and natural intention of which is to make us confident, that He who leads us in this way, the Captain that conducts us, is Gods Son, his moſt dearly beloved; who cannot but be as faithful as he is powerful to make good all his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to us.</p>
                        <p>And we ſhould the rather ſtrive to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after him, and to run with joy the race that is ſet before us, becauſe then we ſhall have the honour ſtill <hi>to teſtify</hi> to him upon Earth; we ſhall be his <hi>WITNESSES</hi> and prove at this day, by his mighty power in our hearts and lives, that he is the Son of God. <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> that read not our Books, cannot be convinced by any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at preſent, ſo much as by this. They ſee how we live; but we can ſhew them no Miracles to convince them, nor can we make them hear the voice from Heaven for their converſion; till we can recommend our Bible to their ſerious conſideration. And the only way to do that, is for us to live more juſtly, ſoberly, charitably and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly than the reſt of the World. By which means they may be brought to have better thoughts of Jeſus, by having good thoughts of us; and be induced to read our Books, by ſeeing ſo much of them in our good works.
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:204181:341"/>And what happy days might we hope to ſee could we but uſe this argument to prove Jeſus to be the Son of God; that no men are ſo good, ſo holy and pure, ſo peaceable and kind-hearted, ſo free from fraud &amp; all guile, as thoſe who are called by his Name? How glorious then would the name of our Lord be over all the world? <hi>His word would run, and be glorified</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> iii. 1.) juſt as it did in ancient days; when they could ſay confidently, <hi>Non de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro, ſed ex illorum numero,</hi> &amp;c.

Shall we do nothing but talk of him, and prattle of our Faith, and make our boaſt that we are right Believers, and damn all Infidel People? Alas, alas! theſe big words will do nothing. As long as they ſee us live no better than they, we ſhal not perſwade them that we believe better.

Hebr. 4.) that we were faithful and righteous, by receiving us, as God did <hi>Abel</hi>'s gifts, up unto himſelf.</p>
                        <p>For hereby alſo we ſhall be inſtruments of conveying this Faith down to Poſterity, with ſome power. Would you not have them believe the ſame that you do? Is it not your deſire that the next Age may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him, as well as this? There is no ſuch effectual means can be thought of to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:204181:342"/>and propagate his Faith, as the fruits of it in an holy life. This will make men afraid now to ſpeak evil of him; and this will teach our Children after us to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous profeſſors of Chriſtianity, and not ſuch cold believers or ſuch infidels as we ſee and hear of in the World. Aſſure your ſelves it is Prophaneneſs which hath made ſo many unbelievers in this Age. Increaſe of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs not only in themſelves but others, hath made ſome ſo impudent as to ſcoff at Religion and blaſpheme Chriſt. While they ſee thoſe who acknowledge him do no better than themſelves, they are inclined to think that their belief makes them no more worth, than thoſe who have none at all. Nay, ſince they concur with them in their wicked practiſes, they imagine that their fear of Hell, and hope of Heaven is no part of their belief, but only of their profeſſion. The hands of Infidels are ſtrengthened in their impieties, by the perfidiouſneſs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly believers. They joyn with them to pull down Chriſtian belief; and make that be thought nothing, which doth nothing above what infidelity doth. And therefore let all thoſe who love the memory of our Saviour, who love their poſterity, and would not have them in danger to be drown'd in a deluge of infidelity, put a ſtop
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:204181:342"/>to it; by <hi>holding the myſtery of the faith in a pure conſcience.</hi> 1 Tim. iii. 9. <hi>Let every one that nameth the Name of Chriſt depart from iniquity,</hi> and endeavour all he can to ſupport the honour of his Name and of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by a ſtrict obſervance of all his holy commands. They who believe not or mind not what they believe, may <hi>think it strange that you run not with them to the ſame exceſs of riot, ſpeaking evil of you</hi> (1 Pet. iv. 4.) <hi>But ye beloved, building up your ſelves on your moſt holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghoſt, keep your ſelves in love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Christ unto eternal life.</hi> Jude 20.21.</p>
                        <p>And that now is the next thing which flows from hence. If we believe the Record or <hi>Witneſs</hi> which God hath given of his Son, it contains in it the greateſt joy in the World.

                  <p>TO caſt your eye upon the Second Part of that Work, the Firſt Part of which I took the confidence to addreſs unto your <hi>Grace</hi> the laſt year. It is concerning that ETERNALL LIFE <hi>which was with the Father,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks; and now is manifeſted to us by his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who hath publiſhed the moſt gracious
<pb facs="tcp:204181:347"/>Purpoſes of God the Father towards us. The thoughts of which, as they cannot but be at all times exceeding welcome to Devout Chriſtians, (eſpecially to thoſe who are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more, then when they ſee their Departure is at hand. In which regards I doubt not this Treatiſe will be acceptable to your <hi>Grace,</hi> becauſe it contains a Deſcription and full Aſſurance of that happy Life which you ſhortly expect. For there is nothing ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving in our declining Age, as to think that the paſſage out of this Life leads us not to Death, but to Immortality: and that it will not take away our Happineſs from us, but give us a purer enjoyment of it: <hi>Pleaſure not mixed with a mortall body, but ſincere and free from Grief and Sorrow. For when we ſhall be ſet at liberty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from this Priſon, we ſhall come thither where there is no Labour, no Sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor Old age: but a Life of perfect eaſe and tranquillity, that breeds no trouble, nor any other evill; but is ſerene and clear
<pb facs="tcp:204181:347"/>in an immovable Reſt and Peace. Where the happy Inhabitants ſweetly contemplate the nature of things; and philoſophize, not for Popularity and the Theatre, but for the finding out ſolid and everlaſting Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have but tranſlated the words of <hi>Plato</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">in Axiocho, p. 370.</note> (or of ſome other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher that hath borrowed his name,) who was much pleaſed in ſuch thoughts as theſe: though he made but uncertain gueſſes at that bleſſed ſtate, which our Lord hath ſo clearly revealed, and ſo ſtrongly demonſtrated; that we have reaſon, with never-ceaſing joy, both in life and death to give him thanks for ſo great a Grace. For as there is nothing beyond this that the heart of man can wiſh; ſo nothing of ſuch importance to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Happineſs in this World. For which cauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> have thought fit to expunge thoſe from the number of <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who do not believe the Immortality of the Soul, and the Reſurrection of the dead: and to reſolve,
<pb facs="tcp:204181:348"/>that they ſhall have no part in the World to come, though they otherwiſe live orderly, and obſerve the Precepts of the Law. For ſuch men, they ſaw, opened a door to all licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and could never doe ſo much good by any other means, as they did hurt by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting this Belief.</p>
                  <p>Which I have endeavoured therefore to eſtabliſh by ſuch Arguments, as they were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, till our Bleſsed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour appeared: who, as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves out of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>uttered things which had been kept ſecret from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World. Maimonides</hi> himſelf ſaith, in his laſt Chapter of his Book concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Kings,</hi> that at the coming of <hi>Chriſt, things hidden and profound ſhall be laid open and revealed to all.</hi> Which is true of nothing more, I have ſhewn, then of that which is the greateſt deſire of all mankind, immortall Life. Of which though I have not treated according to the dignity of the Subject; yet I am confident I have laid a
<pb facs="tcp:204181:348"/>good Foundation, to be improved by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of thoſe who have more skill and more leiſure. And it is a very great ſatisfaction, to have done any thing (though never ſo ſmall) for the honour of our ever-Bleſsed Lord and Maſter: whom it is the higheſt glory in the world to ſerve in faithfulneſs and truth. For He will not fail to reward ſuch ſervices with an ample recompence: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prince ſo great, that nothing is beyond his Power; and ſo gracious, that his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have reaſon to expect the beſt effects of his Good will. Which may very well content us, whatſoever uſage we meet withall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: And ſhould mightily excite us, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> often and earneſtly exhorts

                  <p>I Have no other reaſon to give for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one more to that heap of Books, which men complain is already grown too great; but the hope I have of doing ſome ſervice to our Lord, by making a farther ſearch (as I promiſed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the former Part of this Work) into the Teſtimony of theſe Divine Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, concerning ETERNALL LIFE.</p>
                  <p>The Hope of which is the moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Legacy the Son of God hath left us; the Hindge upon which all Religion turns: without which it would be the greateſt Vanity (as <hi>Lactantius</hi>

                        </gap>, that, being made like to the Angels, we may ſerve the Father and Lord of all for ever, and be the Eternall Kingdom of God. This is the Chief of all things, this is the Secret of God, this is the Myſtery of the World: to which they are ſtrangers, who, following their preſent pleaſures, have addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to terreſtriall and frail goods; and ſunk their Souls, born to celeſtiall enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, into delights as deadly as they are muddy and dirty.</hi>

                  <p>And it is the ſingular Priviledge of Chriſtians, as I have demonſtrated, to be aſſured of a Good ſo great, by ſo many moſt credible Witneſſes: whoſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony none can refuſe, but they that will be ſo abſurd as to believe none at all.

                  <p>The ſerious Reader, I doubt not, will be ſenſible of all this, when he hath peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the following Work. In which I have endeavoured to ſatisfy thoſe alſo, who wiſh I had ſaid ſomething of that part of this Record which I undertook to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; THESE THREE ARE ONE. Which words, I have reaſon to believe, (whatſoever the <hi>Socinians</hi> have pretended to the contrary,) were always a part of this Holy Scripture. For they are alledged by Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Book of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Catholick Church;</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:204181:351"/>ſhew how dangerous it is to break that Unity, by the claſhing of our wills, which not onely coheres by celeſtiall Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but proceeds, as he ſpeaks, from the Divine firmneſs. <hi>For our Lord ſaith, I and the Father are one. And again, it is written of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, Et hi tres unum ſunt, And theſe three are one.</hi> By which that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie would have us to underſtand, not merely the conſent of their Teſtimony, (though that is not to be excluded,) but the Unity of their Nature or Eſſence, we have great reaſon to think. Becauſe there can no account be given, why he ſhould not uſe the ſame form of ſpeech here, which follows, when he ſpeaks of the other three Witneſſes; if theſe three in Heaven were no otherwiſe three then thoſe three in Earth. Which being admitted, (and if we take in the conſtant ſenſe of the Church to interpret the words, we cannot make any farther doubt of it,) that <hi>theſe three are one</hi> in their Eſſence; then it is certain there are <hi>Three Perſons,</hi> whoſe Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is one and the ſame. For elſe there would not be <hi>three</hi> Witneſſes in heaven, but onely <hi>one:</hi> which would croſs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Apoſtle; whoſe ſcope is, to ſhew that our Faith doth not rely upon a
<pb facs="tcp:204181:351"/>ſingle Teſtimony. And indeed the Holy Scriptures, in other places, aſcribe ſuch Actions and Works to each of them, as are proper to Perſons: which is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent warrant to the Church, to expreſs the diſtinction that is between them by this Name. <hi>Non quia Scriptura dicit,</hi> (as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:204181:352"/>and it ſaid, <hi>three Perſons;</hi> (as the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Church ſpeaks;) by which Name it would not have any diverſity under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but onely ſingularity. That not onely <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> ſhould be there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, becauſe we ſay there is one Eſſence; but a <hi>Trinity</hi> alſo, becauſe we ſay there are three Perſons.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Faith we ought to defend; and in this ſimple belief we ought, I have ſhewn, to acquieſce. We ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, becauſe it is the Catholick Faith, revealed in the Holy Scriptures; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they have been always underſtood by the Church of <hi>Chriſt. For it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> (as St. <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi>

They that will inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, need the help of mighty arguments, if they will go about to ſhake the Faith, not of men built on the ſand, and wavering like</hi> Euripus, <hi>but grave, ſettled, and conſtant in their opinion. And while we ſee nothing but mere diſcourſe againſt it, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<pb facs="tcp:204181:352"/>who is there ſo ſilly and brutiſh, as to think the Doctrine of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts and Apoſtles, and of thoſe Lights that ſucceeded them in the Church, to be weaker then their Babble without demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we ſhall not wholly avoid the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of folly, unleſs we alſo reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this plain belief; not buſying our ſelves in more curious enquiries. For the greateſt Lights in the Church, I have ſhewn, will lead us no farther; but tell us we ſhall groap in darkneſs, if we will needs pry too much into this Myſtery. Which we ought to diſcourſe of as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Divines, not Philoſophers. Leſt, as <hi>Henricus à Gandava</hi> cenſures <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> (in his Book of Eccleſiaſticall Writers,) <hi>whilſt we follow too much the ſubtilty of ſecular Philoſophy, we cloud the ſplendour of Theologicall purity.</hi> We muſt remember that we are men, and that our underſtandings are but ſhallow: which ought not therefore to venture boldly into ſuch depths as that of the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. There is nothing ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us, when we think of God, as an holy fear and reverence, producing in us low thoughts of our ſelves. Without which
<pb facs="tcp:204181:353"/>we are not like to be illuminated from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; nor can we, ſhould we know ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much, be acceptable to God. <hi>Quid enim prodeſt alta de Trinitate diſputare, ſi careas humilitate, unde diſpliceas Trinitati?</hi> (as <hi>Thomas à Kempis</hi> honeſtly ſpeaks:) For what will it profit thee to diſpute loftily of the Trinity, if, through want of humility, thou diſpleaſeſt the Trinity?</p>
                  <p>The way to ETERNALL LIFE, it is certain, lies in that rode; which we ſhall be in danger to miſs, if we give our ſelves too great a liberty of diſputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things ſo much above our reach. We ought to be aware of this artifice of the grand Deceiver: who is wont to draw us ſecretly from attending to our known duty, while we are amuſing our ſelves with ſublime ſpeculations. Which the holy Fathers of the Church have careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved, and caution'd us againſt by their ſevere reproofs. <hi>What means</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory Nazianzen
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Orat.</hi> xxxiii. <hi>p.</hi> 533.</note>) this ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humour of diſputing, and itch of the tongue? what new diſeaſe and unſatiable appetite is this? While our hands are bound, why do we arm our tongue? Hoſpitality, Brotherly love, Conjugall affection, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, are no longer praiſed. Feeding the
<pb facs="tcp:204181:353"/>poor, Pſalmody, Nocturnall ſtations, Tears are not now in requeſt. We do not bring under the body by Faſtings; nor leave it a while, to go to God by Prayer. We do not bring the worſe in ſubjection to the better; the Duſt, I mean, to the Spirit. We do not make our life a meditation of death. Our Paſſions are not maſtered. Forgetting our heavenly Originall, we let anger ſwell and rage; and take no care to ſuppreſs that pride and haughtineſs which will at laſt lay us low. We do not chaſtiſe irrational ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor fooliſh pleaſure, nor unchaſte laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor diſorderly aſpects, nor unſatiable hearing, nor immoderate talking, nor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd thoughts, nor any of thoſe things by which the Evill one takes advantage againſt us to our ruine. There is nothing like to this; but quite contrary, we give liberty to other mens evill affections, and (like Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces when they have got the Victory) require nothing of them, but onely that they be on our ſide, and take our part: though they oppoſe God the more impiouſly and audaciouſly.</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>how we ſhall be the Sons of God,</hi> in the other world. We now find (I may adde by a parity of reaſon) a great pleaſure in holy thoughts; we feel the joys of ardent love; are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſht with the melody of Songs of praiſe, and with the ſweet violence of a glance of light from heaven upon us; and we are fure we ſhall be ſo happy as to have a great increaſe of this pleaſure, when we remove from hence: But it doth not appear how we ſhall think; nor what will be the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of heavenly Love; nor what new Songs ſhall be put into our mouths; nor how God will look in upon us, when we ſhall ſee him as he is. We muſt be content to know, that all theſe will bear a proportion to the infinite Goodneſs of Him who is Omnipotent, and hath loved us ſo much as to purchaſe us with a great price, and to give his Holy Spirit to us; and according to the Love of him that died for us, and is gone to prepare a place for us, that where he is, there we may be alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:204181:355"/>In this hope we may now <hi>rejoyce</hi> (though we do not at preſent ſee our Lord) <hi>with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> For I have proved, by undeniable arguments, that God the Father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven power to his Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to make us more happy then we can now conceive; and that He will undoubtedly bring us to live with himſelf. What greater Good can we deſire then this? Or what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Motive can be thought of, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us ſincerely to embrace the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; whoſe buſineſs it is, (as <hi>Lactantius</hi> concludes his Book of a <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Life,</hi>) to direct us to the Eternall Rewards of the heavenly Treaſure? <q>Of which that we may be capable, we muſt preſently diſingage our ſelves from the inſnaring pleaſures of this Life; which deceive mens Souls by their pernicious ſweetneſs. And how great a felicity ought we to eſteem it, to go, being delivered from the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of this Earth, to that moſt equall Judge, and moſt indulgent Father; who for our labours will give us reſt, for death life, for darkneſs light, for earthly ſhort goods, thoſe that are ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall and eternall? None of the
<pb facs="tcp:204181:356"/>ſharpneſſes and miſeries which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure here, while we are employed in the works of righteouſneſs, are in any manner to be compared with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Therefore if we will be wiſe, if we will be happy, let us propoſe the worſt things, that can be, to our ſelves, and reſolve to ſuffer them: ſince it is manifeſt, that this frail Pleaſure we have here ſhall not be without puniſhment; nor Vertue without a divine reward. All mankind ought to endeavour, with all ſpeed, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect themſelves into the right way; that, having undertaken and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the duties of a vertuous life, and patiently endured its labours, they may be worthy to have God for their Comforter. For our Father and Lord, who made and ſettled the Heaven, who brought the Sun and the reſt of the Stars into it, and out of Nothing raiſed the reſt of the World to this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection wherein we ſee it, beholding the Errours of mankind, ſent a Leader, who ſhould lay before us the way of righteouſneſs. Him let us all follow: Him let us hear: Him let us moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly obey. For He alone hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged mens hearts by his truth, and ſet
<pb facs="tcp:204181:356"/>due bounds to their deſires and fears; ſhewing them the chiefeſt Good, to which they ſhould tend, and the way whereby it may be attained. Nor hath He onely ſhewn it, but he hath gone before us in it; leſt any ſhould ſhun the courſe of Vertue, becauſe of the difficulty that attends it. Let the way of perdition and deceit therefore be forſaken; in which death lies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed under the inticements of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And the nearer any man, by reaſon of his years, ſees that day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching in which he muſt depart this life, let him caſt in his mind the more ſeriouſly, how he may go away as pure as may be; how he may come inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to his Judge; and not, as thoſe whoſe minds are blinded, how he may ſatisfie his luſts more greedily before he go. Let every man deliver himſelf out of that gulph, while he may, while he hath ſome power; and convert to God with his whole Soul: that he may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely expect that day, in which God, the Lord and Governour of the World, will judge every man's works and thoughts. Let him not onely neglect, but fly from, thoſe things of which men are now ſo greedy. Let him look
<pb facs="tcp:204181:357"/>upon his Soul as better then theſe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious goods, whoſe poſſeſſion is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and fading. For they go away continually, more ſwiftly then they come: and if we could enjoy them to the laſt, they muſt be left to others. We can carry nothing away, but a life piouſly and innocently led. He ſhall come rich and wealthy to God, whom Continence, Mercy, Patience, Charity and Faith ſhall wait upon. This is our Inheritance, which can neither be taken from any man, nor transferred to another. And whoſoever is deſirous of it, may have it if he pleaſe. But let no man truſt in Riches, nor in Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor in Kingly Power: theſe do not make us immortall. Let us give our mind to Righteouſneſs, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone will be our inſeparable Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, till it bring us to God. As long as we live, let us continue our warfare unweariedly; let us keep our watch; let us valiantly encounter with the enemy: that being conquerours, and triumphing over the vanquiſht adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, we may receive from our Lord the reward of Vertue, which he hath promiſed.</q>

But ſince our Saviour roſe from the dead, it is no longer terrible; but all that believe on him tread it under foot, as if it were nothing; and chuſe rather to die, then deny the Faith of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For they know certainly that the dead do not periſh; but that they both live, and ſhall alſo be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
<pb facs="tcp:204181:358"/>by the Reſurrection. That Evill one, the Devill, who heretofore by death inſulted over us, is himſelf alone now left truly dead. Of which this is a ſign, that, whereas before men believed on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they lookt on Death as very formidable; ſince they embraced his Faith and Doctrine, they do ſo much ſlight it, that they run chearfully to it, and become Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againſt him of our Saviour's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Mere Children make nothing of it. The weaker Sex, (ſo weak is he that had the power of Death now grown,) who were formerly deceived by him, laugh him to ſcorn, as one that is dead, and hath loſt his power. Juſt as a Tyrant, when a lawfull Prince hath vanquiſht him, and bound him hand and foot, is deſpiſed, and made a mocking-ſtock by all that paſs by him, who no longer fear his rage and cruelty: even ſo is Death, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by our Saviour, trampled upon by all his Diſciples; who bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their Maſter, deride it in thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>O Death, where is thy Victory?

                     <q>Mankind, it is certain, naturally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors Death, and the diſſolution of their Body; and therefore it is no ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of our Saviour's victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, that he hath ſo changed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, as to perſwade even chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and tender girls, to make no account of this Life, and with joy to think of Death. It may ſeem to ſome an incredible thing, that Death ſhould thus have loſt its power: but ſo it doth, that there ſhould be a cloath made of an <hi>Indian</hi> ſtone, which fire cannot burn; or that a mighty Tyrant, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all his forces, ſhould on a ſudden be ſubdued, and held in chains, by no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible power. Let him that doubts of either of theſe put on that cloath, or go into the Dominions of the Conquerour; and he ſhall be ſatisfied of the weakneſs of the fire, and of the Tyrant. In like manner, if we meet with an Unbeliever, who, after ſo many Wonders and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Martyrs of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> makes a doubt whether Death be deſtroyed, and a period put to his Kingdome; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not blame his admiration at ſo great a

But thoſe felicities of the Fathers are proclaimed to be granted by the bounty of God, though belonging to this tranſitory life. For thoſe earthly gifts were the things that were openly and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently promiſed and given. Covertly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the New Teſtament was figuratively foretold in all thoſe things, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by a few, whom the ſame Grace was pleaſed to honour with the gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</hi>

                  <p>By which gift, beſtowed not upon a <hi>few</hi> perſons in one Nation, but, as their Prophets foretold, <hi>upon all fleſh,</hi> theſe
<pb facs="tcp:204181:362"/>things, which were then lockt up in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, are now laid open to the view of all: and ſo plainly revealed, that we reade of ETERNALL LIFE oftner in the New Teſtament, then they did of health, and riches, and victory, and long life, in the Old. Bleſſed be the tender mercy of our God, ſhould all thoſe that have any faith ſay, who hath <hi>called us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his marvellous light:</hi> whereby we ſee ſuch things, as eye never ſaw; and ſee them ſo clearly, that we cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly doubt of them. We enjoy the body of that, whereof they had but the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. We have that in ſubſtance, which they had but in picture. The promiſe of that is ours, which they had onely in the type. We have the proof, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the demonſtration of that, which was onely repreſented to them in myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call figures. So far are we illuminated beyond thoſe great Souls, who were the glory of their times, that we underſtand the meaning of their own Books, and the ſignification of all the types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, wherein theſe heavenly things were wrapt up and hidden, better then they could do themſelves. For our Lord is riſen from the dead, and hath opened the Kingdom of heaven; and, tearing
<pb facs="tcp:204181:362"/>the veil in pieces, hath ſet before our eyes the holy place not made with hands, eternall in the heavens. Into which he is entred as our Fore-runner, to prepare a place for us; and from thence hath ſent a more abundant meaſure of the Holy Ghoſt, to enlighten the eyes of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; that we may know what the hope of Chriſtianity is, and how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glorious that celeſtiall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which he intends to divide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. i. <hi>Eph.</hi> 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>But it is not ſufficient to admire this grace, (I have demonſtrated,) we muſt carefully improve it; or elſe it will be worſe with us then if we had never known it. For if the Word ſpoken by Angels was ſo punctually verified, that every breach of it was duly puniſhed: (as it is ii. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2, 3, 4.) there is no hope that we ſhould eſcape the ſevereſt effects of God's diſpleaſure, if we <hi>neglect ſo great Salvation</hi> as this; which <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>It is a fearfull thing to think how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable they will be, who prove thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate; and in how great danger Chriſtians are to be ſo, by the means of that very deceit which plunged the <hi>Jews</hi> into ſo many calamities. Becauſe God had manifeſted more of his love to them, then to other Nations; had given them an excellent Law, ſpoken to them by his Prophets, inſtructed them how to offer Sacrifice, and appointed a place where he would dwell among them; they bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves in the outward enjoyment of theſe ſingular priviledges; they brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb facs="tcp:204181:363"/>that they were the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that they had the Oracles of God, and were a people ſeparated to him from the reſt of the world by many holy rites: but they took no care to be obedient to his Laws; and leſs regarded to be indued with the ſpirit of faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> who left all thoſe earthly goods, in which they placed their chief treaſure, for God's ſake. Juſt thus men ſuffer themſelves to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded at this day. Becauſe God hath granted us the preeminence even above the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves; hath brought us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of his dear Son, made us the Children of Light, and let us ſee ſuch things as many Kings and Prophets deſired to ſee, but did not ſee them; they content themſelves with the bare profeſſion of this Religion, and think it enough to be called by ſuch an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Name, as that of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> on whom they reſt and rely as the <hi>Jews</hi> did on their Sacrifices; never thinking of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with his bleſſed Nature and Spirit, and offering their Wills intirely to God, as he did. Thus men periſh, even in the midſt of ſo great light and means of being ſaved. And there is no help for them, unleſs they will grow ſerious, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the deſign of the Chriſtian Faith.
<pb facs="tcp:204181:364"/>Which will teach them, after a very few thoughts about it, that our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> is <hi>the authour of eternall Salvation to thoſe</hi> onely <hi>that obey him;</hi> (v. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.) and will be ſo far from protecting others from deſtruction, that he himſelf will <hi>be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> i. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>I end this Preface as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins his third Chapter of his firſt Book of the Trinity, with the alteration of one word onely in the concluſion. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reads this Book, where he is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, let him go along with me: where he ſticks, let him enquire with me: where he ſees his own errour, let him return to me; where mine, let him call me back to him. Thus we ſhall all walk together in the way of charity; tending to him, of whom it is ſaid, Seek ye his face alway. Whoſoever therefore, when he reads, ſaith, This is not well ſaid, for I do not underſtand it; let him reprehend my ſpeech, but not my faith. It might, it is likely, have been ſpoken more plainly: but there is no man ever ſpoke ſo, as in all things to pleaſe all.</hi>

                  <p>Now looking a little farther into this <hi>Holy Writer,</hi> who hath preſerved the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable <hi>Records</hi> concerning theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; I find there is as great a certainty of this <hi>Eternal Life</hi> by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as there is of his being the <hi>Son of God:</hi> and that the very ſame <hi>Witneſſes</hi> who ſo fully declare the one, give no leſs ſtrong Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the proof of the other. For THIS (ſays He, <hi>1 John v. 11.</hi>) IS THE RECORD, (or WITNESSE,) THAT GOD HATH GIVEN TO <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL LIFE: AND THIS LIFE IS IN HIS SON. Which words, being a continuation of the foregoing Diſcourſe, carry this ſenſe in them; There is great reaſon you ſhould receive the <hi>Witneſs of God,</hi> (viz. of the Father, Word, and
<pb facs="tcp:204181:370"/>Holy Ghoſt, and of the Water, Bloud, and Spirit,) not onely becauſe it is <hi>greater then the Witneſs of men,</hi> which you cannot juſtly reject; (v. <hi>9.</hi>) and becauſe, if you do reject it, you <hi>make God a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar,</hi> which who can have the heart to do? (v. <hi>10.</hi>) but alſo becauſe the thing which is teſtified to us by theſe <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> when they ſay that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Son of God, is of all other the moſt deſirable; viz. that God deſigns for us no leſs bleſſing then <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> which the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath in his hands to keep for us, and to beſtow upon us.</p>
                  <p>The enſuing Diſcourſe then will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily fall into theſe two Parts. <hi>Firſt,</hi> to ſhew what this <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is; and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> to prove the Certainty of it, from the mouth of all thoſe <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> Of the firſt of which I muſt treat with the greater brevity, becauſe it is not the Deſign of the Apoſtle in this place, to give us an account what the <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is, which God hath promiſed; but to ſhew that he hath given us an undoubted right to it, and that it is in the power of that Great Lord, whoſe Servants we are by Faith in him, to diſpoſe of it.</p>

                     <p>AND now I launch out, when I go about to ſpeak of <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> into a wide Sea; of which it is but little that our eye can deſcry, or our thoughts fathom, and leſs that I muſt confine my ſelf unto, in this preſent Diſcourſe. There is more contained in theſe two words, ETERNALL LIFE, then all the world can diſcover; though
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:204181:371"/>we have ſo good a Compaſs as the Book of God, whereby to ſteer our courſe, and to guide and aſſiſt us in our Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. We may venture, as far as ever our thoughts will carry us, into this depth; but we ſhall ſtill ſee ſomething beyond all that we can conceive, and be enabled by our ſearch to diſcern more fully, that it hath no bottom, no bounds nor limits: as will appear, if you do but attend to this general Deſcription of it out of the Holy Writings. In whoſe ſtyle it is moſt certain it ſignifieth, <hi>a full and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant enjoyment of all the happineſs that our Being is capable to receive.</hi> I ſay <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> becauſe as DEATH in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred language denotes all manner of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, affliction and trouble; ſo by LIFE it expreſſes all kind of Felicity, pleaſure and contentment. And I ſay <hi>full and conſtant</hi> happineſs, becauſe the word ETERNALL muſt needs adde ſomething to the other; and that is compleatneſs, firmneſs and ſolidity. As <hi>Death,</hi> if it be not <hi>eternall,</hi> leaves ſome room for thoughts of happineſs: ſo <hi>Life,</hi> if it want that addition, doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all vexation and ſadneſs. But then, on the contrary, both the one and the other, if this be annexed, are made
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:204181:371"/>perfect; without any hope of happineſs in that <hi>Death,</hi> or any fear of miſery in this <hi>Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To clear our paſſage, I judge it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſpend a few words in making good this Notion of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> by producing ſome places of Holy Writ, where they are ſo uſed. And firſt, for DEATH, the very firſt time we meet with it in God's Book, it is uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs all the Miſery that man drew upon himſelf by his Sin. ii. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> i. e. fall into a moſt calamitous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, (as it is explained iii. <hi>Gen.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19.) till worn out with labour, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and pain, he returned to the duſt out of which he was taken. Thus when the Locuſts came upon the land of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and deſtroyed every green thing, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> intreats <hi>Moſes</hi> (x. <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.) to pray to the Lord that he would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>this Death onely.</hi> Which ſhews, that all the plagues and diſaſters which fell upon that land; went under this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral name of DEATH; though now it be reſtrained to the laſt and greateſt of all puniſhments. The like you reade in the ſecond Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> (iv. 40.)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:204181:372"/>where the ſons of the Prophets, as they were eating of their pottage, cry out, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of God, there is DEATH in the pot;</hi> ſomething that is very diſtaſtfull to the palate, and perhaps hurtfull and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous to the body, which made them they could not eat it. In the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament alſo (penned by men of the ſame country) we find the very ſame language; St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaying that he was in <hi>Deaths often,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 23.) and that he <hi>died daily,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 31.) and wiſhing to be delivered from the <hi>body of this Death;</hi> (vii. <hi>Rom.</hi> 24.) <hi>i. e.</hi> of ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, that it made him ſigh and groan ſorely under the burthen of it. And to name no more, the <hi>Shadow of Death</hi> in theſe Books ſignifies nothing elſe but an horrible, dangerous place; or a diſmall forlorn condition, into which any miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſon is faln.</p>
                     <p>This being the notion then of the word DEATH in the ſpeech of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſuch muſt be the ſignification of the word LIFE which is oppoſite to it; whereby they expreſs all Felicity and comfortable enjoyments. Thus when <hi>David</hi> ſays, his enemies were <hi>lively</hi> or <hi>living,</hi> (as it is in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:204181:372"/>xxxviii. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.) he means, they were in a flouriſhing proſperous condition, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with all worldly goods; while he was abandoned to contempt, poverty, and continual danger. And when he ſays, their <hi>heart ſhall live that ſeek God,</hi> (lxix. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.) his meaning is, they ſhall enjoy true peace and contentment. So when the people ſay, (2 <hi>King.</hi> xi. 12.) <hi>Let the King live,</hi> which we render, <hi>God ſave the King,</hi> they wiſh him a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and happy reign. And when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> acknowledges God to be the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of life,</hi> (xxxvi. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.) it is as much as to ſay, an ever-running ſpring of all felicity, from whom flows, as the foregoing words are, <hi>a river of pleaſures.</hi> Hence they are bid to keep to God's Commandments <hi>as their life,</hi> (xxxii. <hi>Deut.</hi> 47.) And this is ſaid to be the excellency of knowledge, <hi>that wiſedom giveth LIFE to them that have it,</hi> (vii. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.) becauſe by obſerving thoſe wiſe precepts, they were put into a moſt happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which could not be had by any other means, but would certainly be loſt by turning from thoſe holy paths. This is a phraſe ſo known, and the tranſlation of the word to this uſe (ſaith
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>More Nev. par.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 42.</note> 
                        <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>) is ſo frequent, that all good and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204181:373"/>wholſome Doctrine is called <hi>Chajah,</hi> that is, <hi>LIFE:</hi> and thence our Maſters ſay, <hi>The juſt are called LIVING even in their death, and the wicked are called DEAD even while they are alive;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the one were happy, and the other miſerable, in thoſe contrary conditions.</p>
                     <p>The true reaſon of which dialect or manner of ſpeech I take to be this: that LIFE being the foundation upon which all felicity is built, the root out of which it grows, (it being impoſſible to enjoy any thing unleſs we be alive,) and it abiding and continuing alſo, when the pleaſures and other circumſtances of life are often interrupted; it was thought the apteſt thing to expreſs that felicity which we partake of in life, yea the fulleſt felicity, the fruition of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleateſt Good, when life ſhall be made eternal. And if this be not ſufficient to demonſtrate that the Holy Writers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> all the good we are or ſhall be capable to enjoy; you may farther obſerve, that they deſcribe it by all things that are excellent and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, having borrowed from the glory of the whole World whatſoever is love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and illuſtrious, to help to repreſent
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:204181:373"/>it to us. Shall I put together the ſeverall lines whereby it is deſcribed in as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome an order and compoſure as I can; and ſo leave every one to judge of the rare beauty of this <hi>Life,</hi> when it ſhall have all its fillings up, which in its ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der draught appears ſo amiable in our eyes?</p>
                     <p>This LIFE then, that it may be underſtood to be the enjoyment of a fuller good then we can conceive, a good beyond the bold deſires of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and luxurious appetite, is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the hugeſt heaps of <hi>Treaſures;</hi> (ſuch as the Heavens onely are great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to contain;) by the poſſeſſion of an <hi>immortall Inheritance</hi> reſerved there for us; and by <hi>Pearls</hi> and Jewels of a price ſo invaluable, that he is ſtupid who ſells not all he hath, if they are not to be had at a lower rate, to make a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace of them. Theſe expreſſions and the reſt that follow are ſo well known, that I need not ſtay to ſet down the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular places of Holy Scripture where they may be found; but proceed to tell you, that this <hi>Life</hi> is there alſo ſet forth, by feeding upon the delight of the moſt exquiſite <hi>pleaſures,</hi> and being entertained
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:204181:374"/>without any ſatiety, and in the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>company,</hi> at the moſt ſumptuous <hi>Feaſt:</hi> by exaltation withall to the ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt pitch of <hi>Honour;</hi> ſuch as the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Kings,</hi> the majeſty of <hi>Thrones,</hi> and the glory of <hi>Crowns;</hi> which Holy men call in to their aſſiſtence, that they may ſerve to lift up our minds to conceive the height of this happy Life, and make it ſeem the more royal and magnificent.</p>
                     <p>To which you may adde, that they make uſe of the names of <hi>Reſt,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. For as we reade of <hi>entring into Life;</hi> ſo we do of <hi>entring into Reſt,</hi> and <hi>into the Joy of our Lord,</hi> and <hi>dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Peace:</hi> becauſe theſe are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things on earth which can compleat and perfect the happineſs of thoſe who enjoy Princely dignity and power.</p>
                     <p>But then, when the Earth can afford no more colours for the drawing a picture of this moſt excellent Life, or ſupreme Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, thoſe Holy men aſcend up to Heaven, and fetch from thence, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome rays of light, but the very Sun it ſelf, and that in the top of its glory, to illuſtrate by its brightneſs the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:204181:374"/>beauty of it. For it is called the <hi>Inheritance of the Saints in light;</hi> and our Bleſſed Lord is called the <hi>Light of the world;</hi> who promiſes the Juſt, that they ſhall have the <hi>Light of life,</hi> and <hi>ſhine like the Sun in the Kingdom of the Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, alas! it is not in the power of ſuch words as theſe to expreſs its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence. And therefore, when all things that fall under our eyes and our taſte are ſpent in the deſcription of it, we reade then of melodious <hi>Songs and Thanksgivings,</hi> and the joyfull voice of thoſe who triumph continually. Nay, the whole World, as big as it is, is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as a ſmall reſemblance of this Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; wherein victorious Souls are ſaid to <hi>inherit all things,</hi> and to be made <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the Angels;</hi> who joyn in conſort with them, and bear their part in thoſe heavenly Anthems and Hymns, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they bleſs and praiſe the Great Lord of all.</p>
                     <p>But if all the goodly things that are or ever have been in the whole world ſhould meet together, and falling down at the feet of one man, ſhould, with a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:204181:375"/>joynt conſent, conſpire to make him happy, they could never advance him near the height of this celeſtial Bliſs, whoſe incomparable excellence cannot be expreſſed, without the aſſiſtence of words called down from the higheſt Heavens, the place of God's Habitation. And therefore nothing below <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, a Manſion in our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father's Houſe, a Building of God in the Heavens,</hi> is made the portion of ſuch happy Souls. And as if the Heavens, yea the Heaven of Heavens, could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford nothing great enough to repreſent this Bleſſedneſs; Holy men lead us, at laſt, to <hi>God</hi> himſelf; whom they bid us behold in the High and Holy place, as in his Chamber of Preſence. And this LIFE is called <hi>Seeing GOD,</hi> and <hi>beholding his Glory,</hi> and <hi>being with our LORD:</hi> which are names of ſuch tranſcendent greatneſs, that we had need enjoy this Happineſs, to underſtand them.</p>
                     <p>But thus the Men of God, from things ſenſible, lead us by the hand to thoſe that are ſpirituall and inviſible. And now that they have placed our thoughts in the preſence of God, there they leave
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:204181:375"/>them to take as full a view as they can of him, and to ſpread themſelves in the largeſt contemplations of his Perfections. For they were not able to go any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then onely to tell us, that we ſhall be <hi>made like to him,</hi> whoſe Perfections ſhine ſo gloriouſly in our eyes. This is the higheſt pitch to which they carry our meditations. Here they bid us reſt our thoughts; and now that they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced them above the Earth and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, to conſider with our ſelves what it is to <hi>See God,</hi> till we reſemble him, and be perfectly transform'd into his moſt bleſſed Nature and Life. All they can doe more for us, is onely to tell us what GOD is, the enjoyment of whom is our Happineſs: and who, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, will be infinitely far more to our whole man, then Kingdoms and Thrones, then Crowns and Jewels, then Feaſts and Songs, then the Sun it ſelf and all the ſweet influences of Heaven, with the reſt of the things forementioned, could be, were they all united in one deſign to make us happy.</p>
                     <p>The wiſeſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as blind as that Nation is, are ſenſible of this; how diſproportionable all the words, which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:204181:376"/>even divinely-inſpired perſons uſe, are to the Nobleneſs of this Life. In which, ſaith <hi>Maimonides,</hi>

                        <q>there is no room for meat and drink and ſuch like plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; but the juſt ſit with Crowns on their heads, and delight themſelves in the <hi>Splendour of the Divine Majeſty</hi>—. There are many names whereby this Life is called <hi>(Derech Maſhal)</hi> after the figurative way of ſpeaking in the Holy Books. For example, <hi>the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lord; the place of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; the Courts of the Lord; the Beauty or Sweetneſs of the Lord; the Tabernacle of God; the Houſe of God; his holy Temple; the Gate of the Lord.</hi> And after the ſame way of ſimilitude and figurative ſpeech, Wiſe men call this Good prepared for the Juſt, by the name of a <hi>Banquet</hi> or <hi>Feaſt;</hi> and moſt commonly, <hi>the World to come.</hi> Let not this Good ſeem light to thee, nor do thou imagine the reward of Piety to be ſo little, as to drink the richeſt wines, to eat the beſt victuals, to have the moſt beautifull wives, to be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in ſilk and ſcarlet, to dwell in ivory palaces, and to have all the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of gold and ſilver and ſuch like things. But underſtand that there is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:204181:376"/>no Good in this world to which that ſupreme Good can be compared, but onely by way of figure and ſimilitude. In truth, there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Good of the Soul in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, and the Goods of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſuch as meat and drink, in this. But that Great Good is incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and incomparable, according to thoſe words of <hi>David,</hi> xxxi. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>O how great good haſt thou laid up for thoſe that fear thee!</hi> He could not tell how great: but with what deſire did he long after the life of that world, when he ſaid, xxvii. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13. <hi>I believe to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living?</hi>
                        </q> That's another name where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they called this place of Bliſs. For whereſoever their ancient Wiſe men (ſaith their Myſticall expoſition of the Pſalms) meet with this phraſe in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>the land of the living,</hi>

                        <p>And the leaſt that can be meant by it is, that we ſhall be there where He hath his moſt ſpecial reſidence, and ſhall dwell in his Houſe in the Heavens, where there are ſo <hi>many Manſions.</hi> There the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are ſaid to <hi>ſtand</hi> before God, to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face</hi> of our heavenly Father: And therefore for us to <hi>ſee GOD,</hi> or behold him, muſt in generall denote, that we ſhall be more like Angels then Men; and being admitted into the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of thoſe heavenly Miniſters, ſhall take up our habitation in the ſame place where they wait upon the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. Whence it is, that as the Angels are called the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> (i. <hi>Job</hi> 6. ii. 1.) ſo are all thoſe who ſhall be <hi>accounted worthy to obtain that World, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Dead,</hi> xx. <hi>Luk.</hi> 35.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:204181:377"/>of great favour with him; and therefore need not care if <hi>the world hate us:</hi> But we have far greater things in hope, and look for a more excellent relation to him; it <hi>not appearing yet what we ſhall be.</hi> The meaning of which laſt words, in all probability, is this; that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wherein we ſhall be the <hi>Sons of God</hi> in the other world, is not now manifeſt. There is no body knows how near we ſhall be to him, when we ſhall be <hi>the Children of God, being the children of the Reſurrection;</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks in the place before mentioned. Onely this is certain, as I ſaid juſt now, that we ſhall be Companions of Angels, and ſuch <hi>Sons of God</hi> as they are: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all St. <hi>John</hi> here tells us that, <hi>when He</hi> (or <hi>it</hi>) <hi>ſhall appear,</hi> we <hi>ſhall be like him;</hi> it being naturall, that the Child ſhould bear ſome reſemblance to its Father.</p>

                        <p>Now from hence it follows, that to SEE GOD is to enjoy ſuch favours as He will be pleaſed to impart unto us in that high and holy place where he dwells: yea, to have ſome participation with him in his Bleſſedneſs, who is moſt

For to <hi>See,</hi> in the language of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> is <hi>to enjoy,</hi> when it is applied to a thing deſirable; or to be in that ſtate, when it is applied to that which is hurtfull.

Nor is there any other meaning of <hi>ſeeing life,</hi> and <hi>ſeeing the kingdom of God,</hi> but this, that the parties to whom thoſe promiſes are made ſhall be put into the poſſeſſion of ſuch bleſſings. And, on the other ſide, to <hi>ſee the Son of man ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the right hand of power, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the clouds,</hi> xxvi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 64. is to feel his heavy wrath, the ſtroke of his revengefull hand upon their nation; as may be gathered from i. <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. And to <hi>ſee death,</hi> lxxxix. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. ii. <hi>Luk.</hi> 26. is no more then to die. This is ſo plain, that thoſe things that belong to other ſenſes yet are ſaid to be <hi>ſeen;</hi> which can ſignifie nothing elſe, but that they are perceived or enjoyed. <hi>O generation,</hi>
                           <pb n="17" facs="tcp:204181:378"/>(ſaith <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ii. 31.) <hi>ſee ye the word of the Lord;</hi> that is, hear it, mind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it: or, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> expounds it

                              <hi>More Nev. par.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 46.</note>, <hi>the intention of the Prophet is, that they ſhould apprehend the ſenſe of God's word.</hi> And that likewiſe which is ſaid to be <hi>ſeen</hi> in one place, is ſaid to be <hi>taſted</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; as to <hi>ſee death,</hi> viii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 51. is the ſame with <hi>taſting of death,</hi> ver. 52. Which is a demonſtration, that <hi>to See</hi> in their language is frequently uſed for having a ſenſe, perception or enjoyment of any object.</p>
                        <p>And therefore we cannot neceſſarily draw any more out of theſe words of our Saviour, which promiſe that we ſhall <hi>ſee God,</hi> but that we ſhall have as reall an enjoyment of him, and as ſenſibly perceive him, as we do now any good in this world; though the manner of it be not certainly known, as not ſo plainly deducible from theſe words. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with our ſelves, as well as we can, what his infinite Perfections are, his Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his Goodneſs, his Power, his Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his Unchangeableneſs, his Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Bliſs; and then make account there will be a lively communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and all theſe, which will make
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:204181:379"/>us partakers of his Happineſs. We ſhall not onely enjoy ſuch good things as flow from his greateſt favour and love; but in our meaſure, and according to ſuch capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities as he will give us, be what He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is. Thoſe glorious Perfections of his will impart ſomething of themſelves to us: ſo that we ſhall be like God, and bear ſome ſimilitude to him in Wiſedom, Goodneſs, and Bliſs. We ſhall be filled with Divine joys and pleaſures, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with a great ſenſe of him, and a ſtrong love to him, and a lively reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of his bleſſed Nature, immutably and immortally, without any change and without any end. Thus much we need not doubt is included in this phraſe of <hi>Seeing God;</hi> but confidently believe, that good men ſhall enjoy all the effects of an holy Friendſhip with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodneſs, and receive ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications from his boundleſs Love, as ſhall make us really and ſubſtantially hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, like as he himſelf is.</p>

                        <p>And I make no queſtion likewiſe but hereby is ſignified an abundant Felicity which God from his own moſt bleſſed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:204181:379"/>Nature will impart unto us; a very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious participation of Himſelf, which he will beſtow upon us. For when <hi>Job</hi> ſays, xix. 26, 27. that <hi>in his fleſh he ſhould SEE GOD,</hi> and that <hi>for himſelf, his own eyes beholding him, not another's;</hi> his meaning ſeems to be, that before he died, he was ſure God would deal <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding bountifully</hi> with him; not onely reſcuing him from his preſent miſeries, but making him very happy: ſo that he ſhould not onely leave his poſterity, when he was gone, to enjoy the bleſſings which God had ſtill in ſtore for him; but be made in his own perſon partaker of them. Which prediction of his ſeems to have been fulfilled, when it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> and that <hi>he bleſſed his latter end more then his beginning:</hi> xlii. 10, 12. Then he <hi>ſaw God,</hi> and that with his own eyes, when he was thus liberally bleſſed by him, and received ſuch a large reward of his patience. In like manner, when our Lord ſaith, that pure upright men (like <hi>Job</hi>) ſhall <hi>ſee God,</hi> his meaning may be, that they ſhall in the higheſt degree partake of his bounteous Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and receive as much from him above all their thoughts, as Sight is above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="20" facs="tcp:204181:380"/>And indeed the Senſe of <hi>Seeing</hi> is ſo much more ſpacious and wide then the reſt, that we may very well think an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great happineſs is onely able to fill up the whole meaning of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, of SEEING GOD. Which may be the better underſtood, perhaps, if we briefly conſider the reaſons for which the Senſe of Seeing ſeems fitter then any other to ſet forth our participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God in his ſupreme Felicity. They are ſuch as theſe. (1.) It beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with thoſe things whereby God is repreſented to us in the Holy Scriptures. Where we reade that <hi>God is Light,</hi> (which is the object of Sight onely,) <hi>and in him is no darkneſs at all.</hi> As Light is a thing of which we are moſt ſenſible, and whereby we diſcern indeed all other viſible things, but cannot comprehend what it is: ſuch is God; of whom, if we attend, we cannot but be moſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and without whom we can enjoy nothing; though we cannot declare the inconceivable purity and excellency of his Nature. And (2.) Sight is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Senſe about us; the Eye being a work of more curious and exquiſite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance then any other part of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:204181:380"/>And (3.) it is the moſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Senſe, which takes in a vaſt number of things at once; not onely of this lower world, but alſo of the upper. And it is a Senſe (4.) that can longeſt enjoy the ſame object: for its object is not waſted and ſpent in the enjoyment, nor doth it vaniſh and die ſo ſoon as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are apt to do. And (5.) it is the principall Senſe of diſcipline and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which conveys to us the firſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of things more abundantly then the reſt; and eſpecially helps us to the knowledg we obtain by making experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Obſervations. And (6.) it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us the greateſt certainty and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of things. Inſomuch that we are wont to ſay, <hi>We will believe it, when we ſee it:</hi> and it is become a Rule in Law, that <hi>One Eye-witneſs is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then an hundred Hear-ſay's.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain (7.) it is a very affecting Senſe, which raiſes paſſions ſooner and quicker then any other. All the Rhetoricall praiſes in the world which are beſtowed to commend a lovely object to us, will not move us ſo much as one glance of its beauty will. The Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> you remember, was led by report to come to the Court of <hi>Solomon;</hi> but when ſhe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:204181:381"/>
                           <hi>ſaw</hi> the ſplendour wherein he lived, then it was, that <hi>there was no more ſpirit in her.</hi> And therefore (laſtly) it brings in the greateſt revenue of the pureſt and moſt long-liv'd pleaſures, by preſenting us with ſuch a vaſt variety of objects, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Senſes, who have not ſo large a ſphere and compaſs to move in, cannot entertain us withall.</p>
                        <p>From all which you may eaſily gather, that when our Lord expreſſes the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of pure and holy Souls by <hi>Seeing God,</hi> he may well be thought to intend thereby, the ſtrong ſenſe that God will give them of himſelf, and the intimate familiarity we may hope to have with the firſt Wiſedom, Purity and Goodneſs: and then the height and dignity of that ſtate to which we ſhall hereby be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; together with the vaſt meaſure of knowledg and love which he will communicate to us; the exquiſite and moſt delicious pleaſures which will ſpring from thence, and overflow our Souls; the delightfull paſſions whereby we ſhall be tranſported; and the inconceivable ſatisfaction which we ſhall have within our ſelves. For if St. <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid here, <hi>Lord, ſhew us the Father, and it ſuffices;</hi>
                           <pb n="23" facs="tcp:204181:381"/>what ſhall we think of that manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he will make of himſelf to us when we ſhall be uncloathed, and have nothing to interpoſe to hinder our clear ſight of him, and full converſe with him? We are not able to conceive how mightily it will affect our hearts. We muſt ſtay till that happy day of our Lord's appearing, to be ſatisfied to what degree of honour and bliſs he intends to promote us: But ſure enough he will come, and not fail our expectation. The Certainty of this happineſs may well be included in our Saviour's promiſe of <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God:</hi> Who will give us a ſure poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of himſelf, and undoubted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, to the very height, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him; and that in an endleſs life, without any diſquiet or diſturbance, without alteration or change, without wearineſs or diſguſt; in a never-ceaſing ecſtaſy of joy and delight, to find our ſelves united to him, the Almighty Lord and poſſeſſour of Heaven and Earth, the Fountain of all that is good and amiable in this world, who here entertains us with ſo many pleaſures, that by them we may gueſs what he is able and willing to doe for them, who have no greater care then above all things to pleaſe him.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:204181:382"/>They ſhall be fixed in a ſtedfaſt ſight, that is, enjoyment, of him, to their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſatisfaction.</p>

                        <p>And if we mark the words of S. <hi>John,</hi> who ſpeaks this more fully, and tells us, in the place before named, <hi>we ſhall ſee him AS HE IS,</hi> (which he makes the reaſon and cauſe of our being <hi>like him,</hi>) they will imbolden us ſtill to ſeek into a farther meaning of this phraſe.

We ſhall not behold, that is, know him, as we do now, by ſimilitudes, reſemblances, and expreſſions borrowed from other things, (which is all our natures are here able to bear;) but by a clear notion of him formed in our minds; wherein our hearts will be infinitely pleaſed, and feel his happineſs come flowing into them.</p>

                           <pb n="25" facs="tcp:204181:382"/>My meaning may be thus explained: As it is an imperfect ſight of a man which we have in a Picture, though drawn by the moſt curious hand and ſtrongeſt fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and the man himſelf, if he ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Looking-glaſs, will in a moment draw an Image more like him, then the skilfulleſt Artiſt can delineate all his life long, eſpecially if he never ſaw the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but onely had a deſcription of him in a book or by report: juſt ſuch is the ſight or knowledg that we have of God in this world, either by his Word, or by his Works, or by the Idea's of our own mind; a very imperfect thing, and much like the picture of a perſon which we never yet had before our eyes. But hereafter, when he will be pleaſed to appear, to give us a more immediate ſight of him, without theſe helps, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf to our mind as the face to a glaſs; this will be to know him indeed, and to <hi>ſee him as he is.</hi> Now as the ſight of a Friend, when he preſents himſelf to the eye, doth marvellouſly refreſh and comfort us; and there is a ſenſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure imparted to us in the very beholding a rare beauty, which we are not like perhaps to ſee any more: ſo this <hi>Seeing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:204181:383"/>God</hi> is no barren thing, but inſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes the higheſt ſatisfaction and delight into pure hearts; who by knowing his bleſſed Nature, will find it imprinting it ſelf (as it were) upon them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king every one of them to be the bleſſed Image of it. Look what God is, that they by the ſight of him ſhall be: He will dwell in them, as the image of a thing does in the glaſs: And they ſhall be poſſeſſed of him, of his life, of his joys, by having a ſenſible perception of the Wiſedom, the Goodneſs, the Purity, and all the other Perfections that ſhine in himſelf.</p>

                        <p>Or if this be too hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, let us content our ſelves to know, that to SEE GOD <hi>as he is,</hi> is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him <hi>as he is in heaven;</hi> that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that manner and meaſure wherein he ſhews and manifeſts himſelf in thoſe celeſtiall places.

Which as it is higher then this; ſo hath more of God to be ſeen in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:204181:383"/>it, then can be diſcovered here. All that the holy Angels ſee and enjoy of him, all that Good which he lets forth out of himſelf in that glorious place, wherein above all other he is ſaid to be, ſhall be the portion of thoſe happy Souls; who may be ſaid therefore to <hi>ſee him AS HE IS.</hi> They ſhall not enjoy him in ſo low a manner as the higheſt and the moſt highly beloved perſons have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in this world, where there is but little of him: but in the nobleſt manner that he can be enjoyed; ſo as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Miniſters, yea our ever-Bleſſed Lord, are made partakers of him. For when our Lord prays that his Diſciples may <hi>behold</hi> or <hi>ſee his glory,</hi> which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had given him, xvii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 24. his meaning is, (according to what I have ſaid of the word <hi>Seeing,</hi>) that they might have their ſhare at laſt with him in his Happineſs, and be admitted to take a part with him in that ſupreme Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to which he was ready to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:204181:390"/>the perfection of this Happineſs, when they ſhall be again united. We ſhall enter into a great part of Felicity, when we quit theſe Earthly Tabernacles; our Souls ſhall then feel themſelves alive, and alive in the midſt of thoſe delights that will ſtill increaſe and never have any end: and they ſhall joyfully expect the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, and the Glory wherein our Saviour ſhall then appear, and all his Saints together with him; who having received <hi>abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

And yet that little, when we are maſters of any notion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates ſo much pleaſure to us, that we are hugely deſirous of having our minds enlarged to know more; and think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our happineſs, that we ſhould be put into a condition of more free and undiſturbed converſe with Truth. When therefore (3.) we ſhall be rid of this clog, being either alone without this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or having it made ſo ſpiritual, that it will be under abſolute command, and when we ſhall be in a ſtill and quiet place, and enjoy perfect ſettlement of mind and peace of conſcience, (the want of which is the onely thing conceivable to diſturb an uncloathed Soul in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations,) we may reaſonably hope to be put into that moſt deſirable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But we finding (4.) even in this narrow condition, wherein our Souls are pent up, ſuch an infinite thirſt after Knowledge, that the Mind of man is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfied; we may gueſs by that how
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:204181:394"/>vehement this deſire will grow, when our Souls ſhall be no longer impriſon'd, and their capacities ſo much inlarged. And therefore you may conſider farther, (5.) that if this capacity and this deſire in our Souls be not filled, we ſhall be ſo far from leading an happy life, that we ſhall be more miſerable then we are now; becauſe we ſhall be more able to diſcern our wants. And thence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that, to make us happy, our Mind ſhall be gratified, and its widened en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged Faculties filled with a Divine light, proportionable to the power it hath to apprehend.</p>
                        <p>Well then, (6.) conſidering that all objects are finite, and limited both in their nature and number, except God alone, who contains in his own Being all things that are and can poſſibly be; our Minds will certainly be carried to him, as the onely object that can perfect their Happineſs, by ſatisfying their boundleſs deſire of wiſedom and knowledge. He alone <hi>can</hi> fill thoſe Minds who long to know all things, and who have an apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to a vaſter knowledge then now can be conceived. And (7.) who can doubt but he <hi>will</hi> fill them, ſince he hath
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:204181:394"/>promiſed, as you have heard, by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that the <hi>pure in heart ſhall ſee him?</hi> that is, know him and contemplate him in that Eternall LIFE which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath revealed? For in this our enjoying God muſt begin: and it may well be called SEEING in Scripture, becauſe <hi>Knowledge</hi> to the Mind is the ſame with <hi>Seeing</hi> to the Eyes; and the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> to the Soul is the ſame with the <hi>Eye</hi> to the Body. And (8.) we can as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doubt but that their Souls will be moſt happy who ſhall lead ſuch a Life, which begins in their admiſſion to this bleſſed Sight. The contemplative Life, even in this world, hath been thought by the greateſt Philoſophers to be the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and in a manner Divine; as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> endeavours to prove by ſeverall Arguments in the concluſion of his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks.</hi>

                           </note> in another place, that God muſt needs be the moſt Bleſſed, becauſe he perfectly and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually contemplates himſelf; whom all acknowledge to be the moſt excellent and perfect object. And ſince the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſays he, conceives by a kind
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:204181:395"/>of conjunction with that which it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands, ſo that in ſome ſort they are made one; from thence alſo we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that his Contemplation of himſelf muſt needs be the moſt excellent, becauſe it is the moſt intimate, as well as conſtant and never interrupted enjoyment of the moſt excellent Being. The more then our mind can be fixed on God, and the more we underſtand of him, and the nearer we approach to him, the more we ſhall partake of his moſt bleſſed Life; who being moſt intimately One with himſelf, never ceaſes to contemplate his own moſt adorable Perfections.</p>
                        <p>You will be the more ſenſible of this, if you do but imagine how happy many a man would think himſelf, could he but raiſe his mind to underſtand the wonderfull frame of the World, and diſcover the rare wiſedom that lies hid in the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of every part of ſo goodly a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick. If there be ſuch pleaſure in loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into the curious compoſure of this great Book of the Creatures, and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching after all the myſterious learning contained in it, (which employs the ſtudy of innumerable ſouls night and day;) you may eaſily conceive it muſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:204181:395"/>needs be a moſt ſublime ſatisfaction to know him clearly who is the Authour of this Structure, whoſe Artifice now ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes contemplative minds into ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. They ſeem to have meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe anciently who diſcourſed of the Muſick of the Spheres or celeſtiall Orbs, but the extraordinary pleaſure and delight wherewith the minds of thoſe Philoſophers were ſtruck, who beheld the orderly and gracefull motion of thoſe heavenly bodies. And the ſame men ſaid the Mind of man was an <hi>Harmony,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the well-ſet notions whereof it is compoſed, and the ſweet touches that it gives us when it is in tune, and runs into coherent thoughts and orderly ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations. Now look what joy it would be to a contemplative man, if he could know the Art there is in the frame of the Heavens, or if he could but ſo reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Soul as to know its nature, all its motions, the ſpring and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of them, nay, but to know his own Body, which, as the Pſalmiſt ſays, is ſo <hi>fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi> that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhes our minds when we ſeriouſly think of it; and by this you may judge what an happy life it will be, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with God, by whoſe <hi>wiſedom
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:204181:396"/>the heavens were made, and all the hoſt of them by the breath of his mouth,</hi> and who <hi>faſhioned all our Souls,</hi> and <hi>curiouſly wrought</hi> all the members of our bodies, where no eye could ſee but onely his own; yea, to know ſo much of him, that —</p>
                        <p>But it is not in my power to make you underſtand what this Knowledge ſhall be, for that would be to place you in Heaven. Nay, we cannot conceive how God himſelf ſhould make us know it in this ſtate; unleſs he work a change in us, and cauſe theſe bodily operations to ceaſe. All that I can doe is, to make you underſtand, that our Souls ſhall be enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to know more then now we can conceive, and that we ſhall be as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably pleaſed in that knowledge: for the very hope of it now is not without its ſingular pleaſure. You will ask, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, But what is it that we ſhall know of him? Do you tell us of a myſterious Darkneſs, or, which is all one, an inap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Light? This is but to know that we are ignorant. And who can faſten his heart on things of which he hath no perception? or delight in the thoughts of that with which he hath
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:204181:396"/>no acquaintance? I anſwer, We are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready acquainted, bleſſed be God, with ſomething of him; though, as I have ſaid before, we <hi>ſee but through a glaſs, darkly,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 12. As a glaſs repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents not the thing it ſelf, but its image; and he that ſees a thing in a glaſs doth not know it immediately from its ſelf, but from its image: ſuch is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have of God in this life. We know him by the effects of his Wiſedom, Power, and Goodneſs; and by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation he hath made of his Mind and Will in his Goſpel. We know him not immediately and by himſelf; but we know, as it were, an Image of him, in his Works and in his Word. And though this knowledge be but obſcure, and not ſo clear as we deſire; yet ſo much is plainly revealed, that one day we ſhall <hi>ſee him face to face:</hi> that is, we ſhall be more nearly preſent to him, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately contemplate him; who is a Mind and Spirit, joyning himſelf to our very Mind by himſelf, and not by an image.</p>
                        <p>What that is, ſome excellent Souls ſeem alſo to have had a little taſt of here in this world; <hi>by gaſping with the mouth of their heart</hi> (as St.
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Confeſ. Lib.</hi> ix. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note> 
                           <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:204181:397"/>the fountain of Life, that receiving a ſmall ſprinkling from thence, they might perceive after ſome ſort ſo great a thing.</hi> For he ſaith, that as he and his Mother were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing together, a little before ſhe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of the life of holy Souls in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, <q>they had their thoughts carried by degrees above all things ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, till they touched it a while with the whole ſtroke of their heart. And could we but ſilence the tumult of the fleſh, could we make all imaginations of the earth, the air and the heaven it ſelf lie quiet and ſtill; could the Soul it ſelf not ſtir, but, by ſilencing its own thoughts, go beyond it ſelf; could we but liſten alone to him that made all things, and hear him alone ſpeak, not by them, but by himſelf; ſo that we heard his word not by a tongue of fleſh, nor by the voice of an Angel, nor by the darkneſs of a ſimilitude, but him whom our Soul loves in all theſe, it could hear without theſe; (as he and his Mother then did, when with a ſwift thought they touched that eternall Wiſedom, who is over all:) we might eaſily and ſenſibly perceive what eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Life is, by ſuch a moment; and conclude, that if this moment was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:204181:397"/>and all other lower ways of thinking vaniſhing, this alone remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it would be no leſs then to <hi>enter into the joy of our Lord.</hi> Thus he and ſhe diſcourſed, till this World and all the pleaſures in it were forgotten; and ſhe cried out, <hi>Son, there is nothing that I delight in in this Life.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now the hope we have, that what ſome have felt, for the twinckling of an eye, by an intimate conjunction of their Soul with God, we ſhall all at laſt feel in endleſs life, is a mighty attractive to our hearts; the greateſt of all other, though we cannot reach it here. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Good we are to enjoy is ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, becauſe it is bigger then all our preſent thoughts; and the greatneſs of it is not hid from our eyes, becauſe we ſhould not underſtand it, but becauſe we cannot. What more powerfull argument can there be to move our affections, then the conſideration that, though we know not theſe things, what they are and what the manner of their enjoyment is, yet, we know that they ſhall be known and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; and we know alſo ſo much of them and of other things, as gives us aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that the fulneſs of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:204181:398"/>will be beyond all thought plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightfull to us? For, (1.) it is now ſo great a pleaſure to the mind, to behold the wiſedom which appears in the ſmalleſt Mite that creeps on any part of this earth; that we cannot but be ſenſible the higheſt perfection of it is, to have any conception of the Wiſedom, the Power, the Goodneſs, the Eternity, Immenſity, Truth, Purity and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Almighty God; which the longer we look upon, the more we find our minds inlarged, and their thirſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. This perfection of pleaſure then (2.) cannot but be ſtrangely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, when we ſhall come to <hi>ſee him face to face,</hi> and to <hi>know him as we are known:</hi> for our thoughts of him in that ſtate, as was ſaid before, will differ as much from our preſent conceptions, as the underſtanding of a grown Man doth from that of a Child. And then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (3.) we may diſcover ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfection of his, which no man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought of before. New Beauties may reveal themſelves to us, of which we have not now the leaſt notice: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is ALL, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains more in his Eſſence, then we ever framed any Idea or notion of. So that,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:204181:398"/>perhaps, (4.) we ſhall never ceaſe to make ſome new diſcovery or other, but be ſtill beholding more and more of his Glory, to our endleſs ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Let us but cheriſh ſome ſuch thoughts as theſe, and we ſhall feel preſently, by the incomparable pleaſure wherewith they affect us, how powerfull they are to draw our hearts towards this bleſſed LIFE, and all the ways that lead unto it. It was ſome great delight which they preconceived, that made one Philoſopher put out his eyes, the better to be able to contemplate intellectuall things: and which made another travell all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned world over, that he might have the converſation of knowing men: and a third live xxii years in the fields, that he might diſcover onely the manners and the workmanſhip of Bees: and a fourth wiſh he could be able to look upon the Sun, to ſee what it is; though he died the next moment after the ſight: and all the wiſe men, to improve their knowing faculties, take ſuch vaſt and incredible pains. Would any man ſo toil his brain as the Mathematician doth, were there not a certain raviſhment in Knowledge ſurpaſſing all ſenſuall delights? How is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:204181:399"/>the ſillieſt Soul affected, when you bring it the notice of ſome new thing, of which before it was perfectly ignorant? And all pious hearts how glad are they but to think that they are in the direct path to Heaven? And the ſenſe they have of God ſometimes overſpreading their hearts, how much doth it tranſport them, and make them long to have it continue for ever? And therefore think with your ſelves, if theſe little notions of ſenſible things be ſo ſweet, if a ſmall flaſh of light, that breaks in upon us from Heaven for a moment, be ſo glorious; what will it be to have our minds ſo conſtantly illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with the Divineſt knowledge, as the air is with the beams of the Sun? How deſirable is that ſtate, when we ſhall be all ſhining, when our inheritance ſhall be Light, and when we ſhall be able to look upon the noon-day brightneſs?</p>
                        <p>We all find, that a pure and unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Beauty hath a ſtrange power in it to charm the dulleſt minds. Let us ſuppoſe then, with a modern Philoſopher, that there were a Beauty whoſe colours were ſo radiant and bright, that our eye ſhould not be able to look upon it, without the aſſiſtence of ſome new-found Spectacles;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:204181:399"/>by which the luſter of the colours, and the exceeding great purity of its light, might be kept from ſtriking our eye with too piercing a ſplendour. Do you not conceive that, if there were ſuch an object, and ſuch an help to your eye, you ſhould be preſented with a ſight more raviſhing then you ever yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held? and that you would deſire ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to put off thoſe Spectacles, which fortified your eye to ſee ſo fair a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; unleſs you could hope to have your eye made ſo ſtrong, that of it ſelf it ſhould be able to behold it? Ponder then within your ſelves, that juſt as the pleaſure, in ſuch a caſe, would ariſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the excellency of the object, and the increaſed power of the eye; ſo will the delight of ſeeing ſo ſublime an object as God by our raiſed and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Souls, exceed all that which we now perceive in any worldly good, or even in God himſelf. And according to the degree to which our Faculties ſhall be advanced and impowered, which may be as much as God pleaſes, ſo certainly will the fulneſs and the overflowing meaſure of the delight be, which riſes and falls according to the alterations that are in in us; for in GOD there is none at all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="60" facs="tcp:204181:400"/>To all this I have one Conſideration more to adde; that the Soul, as you heard before, by knowledge becomes, in a manner, what it knows: not indeed by being changed into the object, but by receiving the object into it ſelf. As we ſee ſome Bodies admit others ſo intirely into them, that they have all the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the nature which they have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: (iron, for inſtance, in the fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes red, and warms or burns accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as other bodies approach it:) ſo our Minds, by the knowledge they have of things, are after a ſort united to them, and partake ſo far of their qualities, that Heaven and Earth do not differ more, then two Souls do, who have fixt their thoughts, the one on Earthly, the other on Heavenly things. And therefore, when we ſhall come to know God face to face, the ſight of him will be nothing leſs then a full poſſeſſion of him, a kind of becoming what he is, in a true and reall, (as Divines ſpeak) though not eſſentiall likeneſs to him, in Wiſedom, Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, Immortality, and, I may adde, Power too, becauſe we ſhall perfectly command our ſelves, and have our preſent unruly thoughts and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:204181:400"/>affections in a due ſubjection to his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Will. For if, as the Apoſtle ſaith, by beholding now (without a veil, but) in a glaſs the Glory of the Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we are <hi>changed into the ſame Image from glory to glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 18. then much more, when we ſhall come without the help of words and writings to behold the Face of God himſelf, we ſhall be transformed into his image; and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſimilated to his Divine Nature, be made partakers of the joys and pleaſures which are inſeparable from it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And if the transfigur'd Humanity of Chriſt</hi> (as <hi>Anſelm</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>in</hi> Matt. xvii.</note> meditates) <hi>in the company of two Saints gave ſuch delight, when it was ſeen but for a point of time; O how great will the pleaſure be of ſeeing the Deity among the Quires of Angels? If</hi> Peter, <hi>beholding the glorified Humanity, was affected with ſuch a joy, that he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red never to part with that ſight; what ſhall we think of thoſe who ſhall be counted worthy to ſee the Divinity?</hi> We may ask the Queſtion as oft as we pleaſe, but can no more give an Anſwer to it now, then the Diſciples could tell, till they beheld it on the holy Mount, what it was for their Maſter to be transfigured. Then
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:204181:401"/>we ſhall underſtand it, when we come to the High and Holy place where <hi>Jeſus</hi> is; of which that Mountain was but a figure. For the preſent, we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, if we can raiſe up our minds to ſome ſmall conceptions of its greatneſs, by ſuch conſiderations as theſe.

                        <p>And if the nature of this LIFE be farther examined, you will find the <hi>Mind</hi> is not the onely Faculty that ſhall be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſied; but the <hi>Will</hi> ſhall conceive a Love as great as the Knowledge of which I have diſcourſed.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:204181:401"/>the beſt Good clearly known, there will flow the greateſt Love; drawing along with it the greateſt delight, and the moſt perfect repoſe. And therefore to SEE GOD, virtually contains in its notion both Love and Delectation, with Reſt, or Satisfaction. Love naturally flows from thence, as from its fountain; and the other naturally flow from Love. Which is the higheſt act of that Faculty which we call the Will, as knowing and contemplating is of the Underſtanding. Deſire, indeed, is the firſt Motion of it, when any thing is apprehended to be good for us; but that will there be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in poſſeſſion and enjoyment: and no more of it can be conceived to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, then a longing after the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and increaſe of this Happineſs; which, yet, will be ſo certain, that we ſhall be rather confident, then deſirous.</p>
                        <p>The Will therefore, having ſuch a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious object always before it, will be wholly imploy'd in Love, and ſpend it ſelf, without any decay, in flames of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards this Univerſall Good, which ſhines ſo fairly and brightly in its eyes. It will apply it ſelf to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it with as great a vehemency as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:204181:402"/>it can; and laying its mouth (as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> teaches me to ſpeak) to the Spring of all happineſs, do more then taſte the ſweetneſs of it. We may expect to have it filled with thoſe delicious pleaſures which we know attend on Love; and which in that ſtate will be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the greatneſs of the Good that is embraced, and to the ſtrength and arden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the embracement.</p>
                        <p>And whereas here in this world men are wont to love beyond all reaſon, whereby their love becomes adulterate, and is mixed with ſo many diſcontents, that it proves but a bitter-ſweet: There our Underſtanding (as you have heard) will be in its full growth and highe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For who can divert himſelf from ſo beloved a Good, (which ſends alſo ſuch tokens of Love to him,) and turn to any other object? We cannot think that they who love God perfectly, will be inclined to love any thing elſe. And you may think ſo ſtill, if you pleaſe, without any prejudice to what I have ſaid. This will but make that LIFE the more deſirable, and move us to wiſh for ſuch an happy ſtate; where God will be in all our thoughts, and we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways love him, and yet love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too. For theſe are not at all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, but we may delight our ſelves in the ſweet ſociety of Angels and Saints, and yet always SEE GOD; becauſe we ſee and love Him in every thing.

So that our affections will not incline to run to any perſon merely for himſelf; but becauſe we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face of God in him, and ſee his Graces wherewith he is adorned. All the Love there will be Divine: And the more of God ſhall appear in any perſons, the more lovely they will be; and the more we ſhall be raviſht with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and rejoyce in a happy league of friendſhip with them.</p>
                        <p>Well then, withdraw your thoughts a while from all the things you love here, and raiſe them above to look at Love where it reigns, and hath an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled Empire: Behold it ſitting on its Throne, advanced to its utmoſt pitch of Perfection, and ſhewing it ſelf in its full Glory: And then keep the beginnings of this Heavenly LIFE out of your Souls, if you can. It will be impoſſible you ſhould not think, there is nothing ſo much to be deſired as to be all Love. O happy Life, will you ſay, where they love as much as they are able! and where they ſhall be able to love more then now can be conceived! and where they will be beloved more then they can love;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:204181:405"/>and have their Love hereby heightned, when they reflect upon it, in an endleſs Circle of joy and pleaſure! Let us enter upon this Life with all the ſpeed we can make. Let us begin it this very moment; and endeavour that no moment may paſs hereafter, but in the Love of God. For there is no heart ſo ſtony (ſure) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, that will not be diſſolved into fleſh, and receive any impreſſions from God, if it be once touched with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts of this ſtate of Love. No Soul ſo hard frozen and icy, that will not be thawed and melted to run whether God pleaſes, when it doth but feel the leaſt ſpark of this heavenly Fire fall down upon it. Do but go from the reading of this, with the thoughts of this Happineſs burning in your breaſts, and preſerve the fire, for one hour, from going out: and you cannot imagine, till you try, to what an heavenly temper it will puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and refine your Spirits. It will make you heartily in love with the Life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> here, which leads to ſuch a bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Life in the other world. You will zealouſly follow thoſe holy deſires and reſolutions, which you will neceſſarily feel it inſpiring you withall. And you will not ſuffer any temptation whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

                        <p>And the more we think of it, the more we muſt needs ſtill deſire it; becauſe our Underſtanding being filled with the knowledge, and our Will with the love of the chiefeſt Good, we ſhall ſenſibly perceive a Divine joy reſulting from theſe, and flowing into our heart with inexpreſſible pleaſure: For it is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally included in every act both of that Knowledge and that Love, as may be clearly diſcerned by what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid. We are now compounded
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:204181:406"/>of different, and ſometimes contrary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; which frequently diſquiet us, and diſturb our peace, by falling out with our Reaſon, and with one another. But in that bleſſed LIFE there will be no ſuch troubleſome mixture; no fear, no ſorrow, no hatred, no anger, or any the like, remaining: But joy alone, advanced to the greateſt height of glory, will be left in the poſſeſſion of the whole Soul, and have the ſole Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to it ſelf. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſhall for ever have the preſence of the greateſt Good; which will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the preſence of any evil, to give us the leaſt fear of loſing what we love. That's the originall of all our Paſſions: As we are glad when we enjoy any thing that we love; ſo we are troubled when we want it, or when we loſe it; and we are full of care and ſolicitude when we eagerly purſue it; and riſe up in hatred and diſpleaſure at that which oppoſes our deſires. When Love then is ſecure by the poſſeſſion of that Supreme Good, whom no evill can approach, the cauſe of all other paſſions will be baniſhed; and Joy alone be left to triumph in the conqueſt of them. For which cauſe this heavenly Joy muſt needs be the more
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:204181:407"/>exceſſive, when we ſhall have nothing elſe to do, but to rejoyce. This will mightily increaſe the greatneſs of it, that there will be no employment for the reſt of our Paſſions, which here, whether we will or no, take their turns together with it: and conſequently there will be nothing to diminiſh the greatneſs of it, by any trouble or diſorder that can be given it.</p>
                        <p>For the proof of which I need onely refer you to the foregoing diſcourſes, and deſire you to reflect upon what you have read of the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of God. You could not but obſerve how joy and pleaſure was ſo inſeparably knit to them, and interwoven with them, that I could not well ſpeak of them, but I muſt touch upon this alſo.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As for the firſt of them, we all feel a certain complacency which our very Senſes as well as our Underſtanding takes in objects conformable to them; even before our appetite moves at all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. <hi>Truly, the light is ſweet,</hi> ſays the Wiſe man, <hi>and a pleaſant thing it is for the eyes to behold the Sun.</hi> xi. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. Look then how much the Divine Light
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:204181:407"/>excells all other, and how much the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Splendour of the Authour of Nature is beyond the beſt of his Works, the glory and brightneſs of the Sun: and ſo much ſweeter and more pleaſant will it be for our Mind to be filled with that Light, and to behold that firſt and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall beauty, from whence all other are derived. We cannot <hi>think</hi> of God and of our Saviour now, without a ſingular joy: and therefore we ſhall not be able to SEE them, without an exceſs of it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And, ſecondly, as for Love, Joy is a no leſs neceſſary attendant on it, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is intwined with it; being nothing elſe but that delight and pleaſure which ſprings up from the ſenſe of any Good that we have taken poſſeſſion of. So that look how great the Good is to which the paſſion of Love hath carried us; proportionable will be the Joy, when we feel that we are owners of it. And if it now pleaſe us ſo much to think that we are really beloved of God, and of his Son <hi>Jeſus;</hi> what an endleſs pleaſure will the ſenſe of their Love yield us, when it hath placed us in Heaven? Do but conſider now how vaſt the Love of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> is, in coming down from
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:204181:408"/>Heaven to us, and that he knows better reaſons of his Love then we do, and that his own pleaſure is concerned in loving us, and that he cannot but finiſh his Love to thoſe who are purchaſed with his Bloud, and are of his Spirit; and it will give a marvellous ſatisfaction to your heart at preſent. But what it will do then, when he will have expreſſed all his Love to us, and perfected his kind inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards us, we are not able to tell. We can onely conſider a little farther, how he hath plainly told us, that they who love him will <hi>rejoyce</hi> now, becauſe he is gone to the Father. (xiv. <hi>Joh.</hi> 28.) And therefore it muſt needs be an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall pleaſure in the other life, to <hi>ſee</hi> (what we here <hi>believe</hi>) our Deareſt Lord ſhining in the Glory of God the Father, and inthroned on the right hard of the Majeſty in the Heavens. It will be an exceeding high ſatisfaction to us, to behold him, who loved us ſo much, and was ſo ill requited for it by men, ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly rewarded for it by God himſelf. — But it is ſo eaſie to apply what hath been ſaid to this purpoſe, that I ſhall leave ſuch conſiderations as theſe to your own dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and note ſomething that is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo obvious.</p>

                           <pb n="77" facs="tcp:204181:408"/>3. Which is, that pious Souls will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably augment their joy, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions they will make upon their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and the ſtrong attention of their mind to their own delight and pleaſure. For we are never ſo truly delighted, as when we find that we are not deceived in the comfort and contentment which we promiſed our ſelves; and when we take notice of all the pleaſing motions that are in our hearts, and duly mark and obſerve the ſweetneſs of them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this reflexion and ſelf-obſervation; our Souls are onely touched by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which they apprehend, and receive ſuch impreſſions as they are able to make there: But by this means the Soul tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ſtrikes it ſelf; ſealing thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions deeper, and preſſing them har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon our ſpirit. The preſence of a Friend, without asking our leave, excites a joy and ſudden paſſion of pleaſure in our heart, upon his very firſt approaches: But when we conſider with our ſelves, not onely that he is our Friend, but how good a Friend he hath been, and what joy he hath now and many other times given us; we then affect our ſelves with his preſence and ſweet company, and make the joy greater by minding how
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:204181:409"/>great it is. For it is the higheſt kind o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>We have many conſiderations left us now, in the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to refreſh our minds withall, from his great Love
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:204181:409"/>in becoming a Man for us, from his Croſs, from his Reſurrection, from his Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſitting at God's right hand, from his promiſe of coming again, and the hope we have of reigning with him for ever: but by not attending to ſuch bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Truths as theſe, we loſe the comfort of them. And when they are mightily urged upon us by others, and the Holy Spirit of God alſo touches us, and makes us ſenſible of the glad tidings that they bring us; we loſe ſtill a great deal of the pleaſure, by not preſſing them farther upon our hearts, marking how they are affected with them. And when all this is done, we ſhall ſtill feel a damp upon our ſpirits, unleſs we can comfortably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon our own ſincere love to God, and aſſure our ſelves that we are perſons qualified for this ſupreme Joy. But there will be no danger of any ſuch defects in that happy World above; where holy Souls will as readily improve, as they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcern, every thing that gives them ſatisfaction. As nothing will eſcape their obſervation which brings any joy along with it; ſo they will pleaſe themſelves in the contemplation of their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, till they grow greater. And ſo far they will be from wanting any reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:204181:410"/>on themſelves as the perſons whom God loves and delights to honour, that they cannot but perceive it, and be tranſported with the joyfull ſenſe of it. For, if we ſhould ſpeak ſtrictly, this Joy will be ſo great, that it will need no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to it. Its own ſtrength will make it be moſt ſenſibly felt; and (as ſome have ventured to expreſs ſo ſublime a ſtate) it will, by the tranſcendent force of its delight, eſſentially reflect upon it ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But let us come down from theſe heights, and conſider again, that as much as the Joy which God hath in himſelf exceeds all other ſatisfaction, ſo much will the Joy which we ſhall have in him exceed all that we have or can enjoy in any other thing. <hi>In his preſence</hi> (ſays the Pſalmiſt, xvi. 11.) <hi>is fulneſs of joy, and pleaſures everlaſting:</hi> which cannot fail to be the portion of thoſe who ſhall be admitted into his preſence, and have the happineſs to <hi>See</hi> him. For ſince by our ſight of him we ſhall be aſſimilated to him, (as was ſaid before,) and made in a manner ſuch as he is; we muſt needs be partakers with him in his Joy as well as in other things, and have ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:204181:410"/>of it as exceeds all the meaſures that our ſcanty apprehenſions can now take of ſo full a Good. It is too little to ſay, that this Joy alone exceeds all worldly pleaſures, as far as the longeſt life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds a moment, or this whole World the leaſt mote we ſee in the Sun-beams: ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may ſay, as far as God ſurmounts this World, or Eternity Time; between which there is ſcarce any compariſon to be reaſonably made.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. To all which you may ſubjoyn this, as the higheſt conſideration of all, that ſuch are the Perfections of the Divine Nature, ſuch is his infinite Bounty, that they who are united to him in Love, will meet with an infinite Satisfaction. All objects of our delight here may be comprehended by our Underſtanding, and we may ſee <hi>an end of all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> For which reaſon they may be ſlighted by our Will, as leſs then our ſelves, and unable to give us the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment we deſire. It is at our choice whether we will love them or no, or at leaſt what portion of our love we will beſtow upon them: and therefore it is no great joy that they can give to one, who feels how much he is above them.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:204181:411"/>But God now is ſo full, ſo infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us, that he intirely ſatiates the heart of thoſe that love him. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refuſe him, when we are perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him; nor is it at our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to love him but to ſuch a meaſure. No, He will force our Soul then to love him and delight in him as much as it can; yea, more then naturally it could without the preſence of ſuch a Good; more then it believed it ſhould ever have been able to love. And this is not a force of which the Soul grows weary, as in other caſes when it is ſtrained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its preſent capacity; but a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing violence, to which it opens it ſelf, and perceiving the power of that great Good, would willingly be more poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it. The pleaſure that it feels ſweetly dilates it, and with a gratefull conſtraint ſo ſtretches and widens it, that the extenſion becomes natural to it. And with all this New Love created in it, the joyfull Soul will for ever remain thus big; embracing its moſt beloved Good, and delighting it ſelf in this largeneſs of Love.</p>
                        <p>This is the incomparable pleaſure of the LIFE that <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſes. All
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:204181:411"/>other joys are but cold and dull, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the flames and ſpirits of this. It is but a dream of drowzy delight which we enjoy here, in compariſon with that ſubſtantiall ſprightly pleaſure which our Souls will find in the boſom of God's Love; wherein they will repoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch a tranſport, as if they would loſe themſelves to be all one with him. Whoſoever he be therefore that is inſenſible of all other charms, let him hearken to this; and ſee what pleaſure can doe, to make him in love with this Life of our Lord. Pleaſure, I ſay, which all mankind moſt paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, be it never ſo weak and imperfect: the Light of all good things; which ſhould we ſuppoſe ſeparated from humane life, it would be nothing but darkneſs and horrour. And if thou knoweſt not yet what ſpirituall delight means, let thy fleſhly pleaſures tell thee ſomething of this happineſs. If thou art not ſo ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, as never to have a thought of any thing beyond the ſatisfaction of thy fleſhly luſts; think how much more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Spirit and the pleaſures of it are, then a Body and all its delights. And then raiſe up thy mind a little higher, to conſider, that if pleaſure have now ſuch
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:204181:412"/>power over thee, here are the greateſt to invite thee. Pleaſures, that as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thoſe of the ſpirit, as they do thoſe of the fleſh: Pleaſures at God's right hand; the very joy of the moſt High, the Father of ſpirits; the pleaſures of God himſelf.

                        <p>WE muſt ſtay, as I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the reſolution of ſuch Queſtions, till we enter into that Joy. And for the preſent be glad to know, that our Souls being thus happily diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhining with the Divine Light, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Divine Love, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in both, muſt needs iſſue forth in the moſt chearfull and delightſome Praiſes of God, who hath preferred us to ſuch a bliſsfull ſtate. For this we all find is one of the naturall effects of Joy, here in this Life. As it tranſports and raiſes the Soul above it ſelf; as it makes us eager to poſſeſs, if it were poſſible, more of that Good which gives ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and as it makes us for the preſent forget all other things, all the cares and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:204181:414"/>troubles of this life; and, indeed, ſo much betters and improves our Soul, that of all other things we are not willing to forgo it: So it never fails likewiſe to employ the tongue in praiſing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending that Good, to which it owes it ſelf. How barren ſoever the Mind be, or what ſlowneſs ſoever there be in our Tongues; joy and pleaſure make us fruitfull in Thoughts, and quicken our Speech to declare the content we take in the company of that which is the cauſe of it. Nay, the Voice becomes bigger and louder by its means; and it never utters it ſelf, but with earneſt notes of its high ſatisfaction. And therefore it is impoſſible for the raviſht Soul, when it is come to the delightfull Viſion of God, to refrain from joyning with the Heavenly Quire, to give <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt,</hi> that is, after the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manner, and with the moſt exalted affections.</p>
                        <p>As the Underſtanding, by reflecting upon the bleſſedneſs of the whole Man, will excite an extraordinary Joy in the heart, (as I have juſt now diſcourſed:) ſo, by reflecting upon the fountain from whence that happineſs flows, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:204181:414"/>obſerving the Originall of its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, it cannot but excite in it ſelf admiration and wondering thoughts; and preſently employ them to invent the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt hymns and ſongs of praiſe, whereby to magnifie and laud this glorious Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. And this will make ſtill greater additions to the Joy before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, which muſt neceſſarily be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with theſe moſt affectionate Thankſgivings; as every one can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs who hath tried this heavenly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, which the Pſalmiſt, in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, found ſo <hi>good,</hi> ſo <hi>pleaſant, and</hi> ſo <hi>comely.</hi> cxlvii. 1.</p>
                        <p>Were all the mercies of but one day placed now in a clear view before your eyes, or could you but at once behold all the bleſſings that are crouded into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment; what admiration would it raiſe up in your hearts? what a volume of praiſes would you be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? and how much ſweeter would this one act of lauding and praiſing God be, then the enjoyment of all the good things you praiſe him for? Raiſe up your minds then to conceive the height of thoſe Praiſes, that will be continually ſpringing and bubbling up from thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:204181:415"/>hearts, and always filling their mouths; when they ſhall be able to ſhoot their thoughts down to the very bottom of their days, and ſee all the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Providences of God about them, all the favours they have enjoyed, and all the dangers they have eſcaped as they paſſed through the tumultuous Sea of worldly affairs. O what Hallelujahs will it create, when theſe ſhall be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thick together, or ſtand at once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us? and when we ſhall not onely look upon the paſt loving-kindneſſes of God in one train of thoughts; but in the next behold all our preſent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the quiet ſhoar where we are lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with the riches and pleaſures of the Heavenly Country? and when we ſhall alſo think again of thoſe that are ſtill fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which are always beginning, and never ending, always preſent, and always to come? This ſure will make the voice of praiſe more loud and ſhrill, and every note ſo ſweet, that it will give the moſt gratefull touch unto the heart.</p>
                        <p>Look upon the little Birds, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken how they chirp and ſing in the wide and ſpacious air, where they have no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſet to their liberty: and then think
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:204181:415"/>what a chearfull life they lead, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with one that is perpetually coup'd up in a cage, and ſpends many loneſome days and melancholick nights in that ſolitude. And look again upon your own Souls, which we think are capable of the higheſt pleaſures; and cannot you conceive a little how delightfull they will find it, to be always ſinging in the vaſteſt liberty and freedom; to be ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their wings in the boundleſs Light to which God will bring them; and to be uttering their joys, as they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves incompaſſed on all ſides with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable objects of contentment? O how infinitely will it tranſcend all that they are capable of while they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, or rather pinioned, in this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? though one moment of thoſe Joys which are ſometimes felt here by holy Souls, is not to be exchanged for all that the world can offer in its ſtead.</p>
                        <p>And theſe Songs will be made the more melodious, by the company that ſhall joyn together in the moſt harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſort. All the Saints and Angels will make up but one happy Quire; and will all ſtrive, we may imagine, with an holy emulation to excell each other, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:204181:416"/>without any envy contend who ſhall ſing the loudeſt and ſweeteſt praiſes to our Creatour and Redeemer. And what delight, may we conceive, will they take in the delicate ſtrains of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? How will they be pleaſed to hear their own voices accompanied with the hymns of ſo many celeſtiall creatures? How will the whole number be even rapt out of themſelves by the melting airs of the whole Quire; when they all lift up their voices together, as thoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads of holy ones which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw (v. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.) acknowledging <hi>the Lamb worthy to receive power, and riches, and wiſedom, and ſtrength, and honour, and glory, and bleſſing,</hi> which (as he ſays v. 13.) all good Chriſtians even in this world delight to aſcribe <hi>unto him that ſits upon the throne, and to the Lamb, for ever and ever?</hi>

Where we attending upon</hi> Jupiter, <hi>and others upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods, ſhall be admitted, if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſpeak it, to celebrate the moſt bleſſed Myſteries. Which we ſhall joyfully obſerve, being intire, and inſenſible of any of thoſe evills which expected us in our latter days. And we ſhall be admitted to the myſterious contemplation of thoſe perfect and ſteady ſights, in pure light: being our ſelves pure and diſingaged from this body, which we carry now about with us; to which we are tied as faſt as an oyſter is to its ſhell.</hi> They felt, it appears by theſe words, very ſtrong motions in their Souls after a ſight of thoſe things, to which they could not reach while they were in theſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And they had a faint hope alſo, that, when they were got looſe from theſe ſhackles, they ſhould neither be confined nor clouded; but in pure light and liberty rejoyce and be glad in the love of their gods, who they expected would admit them to the knowledge of ſuch ſecrets, as they imparted onely to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:204181:417"/>their Friends. For that's the meaning of celebrating the Myſteries; which were Secrets that all were not permitted to ſee, and when any had ſeen, they might not reveal; but were kept with feſtivall joys, after the moſt ſolemn manner, by thoſe who were thought worthy of them. To the delight of thoſe feaſts he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the joy they ſhould have in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life; which they were wont to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to all thoſe who were admitted to the ſight of their Myſteries. There they fanſied they ſhould rejoyce in a nobler manner then they did when they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the pomp of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Ceres;</hi> (to whoſe myſteries this Authour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes;) and without that noiſe and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult which accompanied ſuch trains, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in quiet the unknown ſpectacles of the inviſible World.</p>
                        <p>But if you think that all the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I have uſed borrow too much from ſenſible things; yet remember at leaſt what delightfull touches a ſweet voice, or other excellent muſick, hath in any moment given your Soul; and conceive then what a pleaſure it would be, to have two hours continued like that one minute, or your ſpirits ſo delicately
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:204181:417"/>moved for one whole day together. By this means you will the better underſtand the truth of what I have ſaid: for juſt ſuch is the pleaſure of thoſe Souls, which now ſtrike themſelves and touch their own hearts with a lively ſenſe of the Goodneſs of God towards them; and which feel withall the finger of God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the like ſtroaks upon them. There is nothing ſo delicious as this, nothing ſo powerfull to raviſh them out of their bodies. The very ſtrings would crack, and the Soul and fleſh would diſſolve their Union, ſhould there remain ſuch a powerfull and delightfull motion for ſome hours, as for a little ſpace they ſometime feel tranſporting them. They cannot but imagine, that the prolonged harmony of one day, ſhould it bleſs the Soul, would make it account all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in this world harſh and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; and cauſe it to cry out, as the man St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaks of, who after he had dreamt he was in Paradiſe, called ſtill to thoſe who were about him, <q>Set me again in thoſe flowry fields: reſtore me to thoſe pleaſant walks. O let me enjoy that melody once more; let me hear thoſe ſweet ſongs: trouble me no more with any of theſe worldly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:204181:418"/>noiſes; but bleſs me again with thoſe heavenly touches.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Lift up your minds then by ſuch thoughts as theſe, to conceive what not one day, or year, or age, but an eternity of ſuch rare raviſhing delight would be; and that is a part of that bleſſed LIFE which I am treating of. Which by your own confeſſion muſt needs be more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then all that can be expreſſed by Muſick and ſweet Airs, and melodious Strains and Songs, or any ſuch like words: which muſt be acknowledged to be weak and imperfect, able to expreſs onely the outward images and ſhadows of thoſe Divine enjoyments. And the more perfectly you digeſt and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excite ſuch thoughts as theſe, the more you will apprehend of this bliſs; and the more impoſſible it will be, that any thing ſhould hinder you from beginning to be ſo happy, by devoting your ſelves to a Chriſtian life. One part of which is, to praiſe and bleſs the Lord at all times; to bear in your gratefull minds a faithfull remembrance of his benefits, and to expreſs it as oft as you can in the moſt thankfull acknowlegments. In which exerciſe whilſt you ſeriouſly employ
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:204181:418"/>your ſelves, you will be able thereby to know in part what the bleſſing of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Life is, wherewith our Lord hath promiſed to reward our hearty obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

And the <hi>Will,</hi> which now is oft too refractory, will not then in the leaſt rebell againſt the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but be obſequious to its il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations. And the <hi>Affections</hi> will be as ready to obey the Will, and follow its motions: which will all agree with the Mind of God, and perfectly correſpond to his deſires. His Will ſhall be always done, and ours ſhall be but a ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his. For our knowing him making us like him, will take away all
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:204181:419"/>liberty from us of doing any thing but what he would have us. And the whole appetite being ſo intirely filled and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as hath been ſaid, with this great Good, there can be no room left for any inordinate deſires; but we muſt eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleave to God, and cannot be turn'd aſide from him any more.</p>
                        <p>And it will not prove any trouble to us neither, to be thus faſt bound to his will, and obſerve all his motions: but we ſhall fly as ſwiftly about in that free light, as the winged Angels now do; who never fetch ſo much as one ſigh when they receive his commands, but chearfully in every thing obey his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Nay, it would be the greateſt trouble to us, if we ſhould doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. We ſhould create a diſturbance in the midſt of that heavenly Reſt, ſhould we not thus readily obey him. One groan would ſpoil all the ſweet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents of the joyfull Praiſes which are there continually offered. Much more would one act of diſobedience be ſo jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with that harmony, as to make us loſe the pleaſure of it. But there will be no danger of this; we ſhall all be changed, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, not onely
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:204181:419"/>in our Body, but alſo in our Spirit: and in this, as well as all other things, that our liberty of indifferency, the freedom we now have to chuſe good or let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, yea to chuſe evill as well as good, ſhall be turned into a chearfull ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous motion towards that which is Good alone. The will, as ſome have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, ſhall remain; but not the choice: we ſhall willingly ſerve God; but not chuſe whether we will ſerve him or no.</p>
                        <p>For that Sight which we ſhall have of his Beauty will not let us take our eyes off from him; and that Love which flows from thence cannot but be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by thoſe who have that bleſſed Sight: and they that cannot but ſee and love ſo great a Good, will not be able to turn their minds and hearts inordinately to any thing elſe. They therefore who ſhall be accounted worthy of that World to come, will be free from Sin, and from the fear of ſinning; whereby they will be ſecure of perpetuall Bleſſedneſs: which is neceſſary to make us perfectly happy. For they are very ſhort of it, who are in danger or in fear of loſing the felicity they enjoy. Both theſe will be far remote from that happy World;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:204181:420"/>where they will be fixt in their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe they will be fixt in their Obedience. Which as it may grow, it is poſſible, ſtill more and more chearfull; ſo it will infuſe a greater ſenſe of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love into their hearts; and every act wherein they doe the will of God may be rewarded perhaps with a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of happineſs.</p>
                        <p>Who would not chuſe then to obey God now, that hereafter he may not be able to doe otherwiſe? Who would not ſtrive to bring his will in ſubjection to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he may at laſt exchange his own will wholly for his; the liberty, that is, of a man, for the liberty of the Divine Nature, which is always determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by an happy neceſſity to that which is Good? Yea, who would not chuſe ſuch an happineſs as is always, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, growing more perfect? the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of which we can never compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, becauſe it will be growing more excellent? A Life ſo noble, that every operation of it makes it more divine? It is no diſparagement to its worth, to ſay, that we cannot at firſt know all that we ſhall know, nor love ſo much as we ſhall be able to love, nor poſſeſs all the joy of

                        <p>But it is time to bring this Diſcourſe to a concluſion, when I have told you, that it is not the Soul onely which will be happy in this <hi>Eternall LIFE.</hi> That word, I ſaid at the firſt, imports the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme felicity of the whole Man: and therefore Man conſiſting of a <hi>Body</hi> as well as a Soul, that muſt come in for a ſhare in this Bliſs, and at laſt be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of it. Yet I ſhall not ſtay to tell you particularly what the LIFE of the Body ſhall be after the Reſurrection; becauſe I have been longer then I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in deſcribing the operations of our nobler part about its higheſt Good. It ſhall be ſufficient to give you but theſe <hi>two</hi> marks, whereby to know the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding happy condition to which it will be promoted. <hi>Firſt,</hi> it muſt needs be transformed into a very noble Being, which is to be the companion of ſuch
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:204181:421"/>an exalted Soul, and be capable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it in theſe ſublime operations. We reade much of its brightneſs and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which the Scripture ſeems to ſay ſhall be ſo great, that it will contend with the ſplendour of the Sun it ſelf: And we may very well believe it, ſeeing it is to be the Veſture of a Spirit ſo illuminated by the Viſion of God. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, among others, it may be that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls it a <hi>Spirituall</hi> Body. Which as it needs no ſupports of meat and drink, and is made immortall, and no longer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any diſeaſe: ſo is it of a purer ſenſe and a quicker power then this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fleſh, moving with ſo much agility and eaſe, that we ſhall feel it is no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to us. And the Apoſtle indeed tells us, (which is the <hi>Second</hi> thing) that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by his power which is able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things to himſelf, will <hi>faſhion it like to his own glorious body.</hi> iii. <hi>Phil.</hi> 21. Now what the brightneſs of that is, you may gueſs by the Viſions of the two great Apoſtles, St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt of which, when he ſaw our Saviour transfigured in the holy Mount, (<hi>Matth.</hi> xvii.) was ſo overcharged with joy, that the ſight put him in a manner
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:204181:421"/>beſide himſelf. For he knew not, ſaith the text, what he ſaid, when he uttered thoſe words, <hi>Let us make here three ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, one for thee, and one for Moſes, and one for Elias.</hi> He knew indeed that it was <hi>good being there,</hi> ix. <hi>Luk.</hi> 33. though he ſcarce knew where he was. This was the onely thing in his thoughts, that they ſhould be moſt happy men, might they never ſtir from that glorious place; but always remain thus tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as at preſent he was. Let us be fixed here, was his wiſh; let us always live in ſuch pure light, and enjoy ſuch beautifull ſights: from whence he was loth to take his eyes, or to leave ſuch good company as now <hi>appeared in glory,</hi> v. 31. And yet this, you muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, was no more then a glimpſe of that Glory which our Saviour was to have after his Reſurrection, and which he now ſhines in, and ſhall one day be revealed. Judge then by this, what happy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they will be, whoſe bodies ſhall be made <hi>like that glorious body;</hi> which when it was but a while transformed in this world, made the place ſeem no leſs then a Paradiſe. How illuſtrious will the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of true Chriſtians be, when they ſhall not merely dwell in ſuch <hi>Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
                           <pb n="104" facs="tcp:204181:422"/>as St. <hi>Peter</hi> wiſht; but in bodies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that which was ſo transfigured, or rather of a far greater ſplendour: there appearing then, as I ſaid, but a twinkling of that Glory of our Saviour, to whom we ſhall be conformed.</p>
                        <p>For if you obſerve it afterward, when the Heavenly light of our Saviour's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Body incompaſſed the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (to whom he appeared in his way to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi>) he could not look upon it, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> had done upon the other: but it was ſo ſhining, that it put out his eyes, he continuing <hi>three days without ſight.</hi> ix. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. And for any thing we know, he had never recovered the uſe of them more, had not the ſame <hi>Jeſus</hi> reſtored his ſight to him by a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Theſe ſenſes of fleſh were not able to bear a Light ſo effulgent. It was to deprive them of all their operations, to approach near to ſuch a brightneſs. And yet ſuch glorious creatures will our Lord make his faithful Servants. So aſtoniſhing is his love, that he will never ceaſe his kindneſs to them, till they be <hi>numbred among his Saints in glory everlaſting;</hi> that is, till he impart his own moſt excellent glory to them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="105" facs="tcp:204181:422"/>Which ſignifies that they muſt be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully changed from what our bodies are now in this vile ſtate; wherein they are not capable to behold ſuch a glory as ſhall then be revealed. But the ſerious belief and hope of it founded upon the word of our Saviour, and of thoſe who were <hi>eye-witneſſes</hi> of his Majeſty, is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous comfort to us; and ſhould make us ſtudy to purify our ſelves more and more, and to perfect holineſs in the fear of God. We ſhould cleanſe and refine our affections, and render them ſtill more ſpirituall and heavenly; that being leſs moved with the things of this world, and finding our inclinations weaker towards them, we may more readily and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully comply with the will of God, and prevent as much as we can the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead: when we ſhall have no luſt to doe otherwiſe then as God would have us, but ſhall intirely pleaſe our ſelves in accompliſhing his good will and pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>For the more faithfully and eminently any perſons ſerve the Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> out of pure love to him and to his Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the greater marks of his favour will he ſet upon them. Their very Bodies,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:204181:423"/>it is probable, will ſhine in a greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and be made ſo much the more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, according as their light here ſhone brighter before men, and moved them to glorify their heavenly Father. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to teach, not onely that the bodies we ſhall have after the Reſurrection will differ as vaſtly from thoſe we have now, as Earth does from Heaven; but that thoſe heavenly bodies which we ſhall put on will differ very much among themſelves in brightneſs and glory. As <hi>the glory of the celeſtiall bodies is one, and the glory of the terreſtriall another:</hi> ſo he tells us, (among the celeſtiall) <hi>there is one glory of the Sun, and another glory of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars; for one ſtar differeth from another ſtar in glory. So alſo is the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 40, 41, 42. That is, ſome will have bodies more bright then others, and ſhine as Stars of a greater magnitude; to note them to be perſons of eminent rank, who have done very glorious ſervice to their Lord.</p>
                        <p>The Martyrs, for inſtance, whoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were ſlain or burnt to aſhes for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake, we may well ſuppoſe will be more ſplendid then thoſe who were laid in their graves in peace. Nay, the

                           <hi>we ſhall ſee them: For it will not be a deformity in them, but a dignity; and in the body will ſhine the beauty of their vertue more then of their body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This the Writers, whom we call the Schoolmen, imagine is the <hi>Aureola</hi> or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle golden Crown which the Judge will give to rare Vertues. By which they mean ſome accidentall reward ſuperadded to the eſſentiall Bleſſedneſs. Like the little crown of gold, wherewith the other crown upon the Table of Shew-bread was finiſhed, as the <hi>Vulg.

But that the overplus of reward which <hi>Chriſt</hi> will give to ſome ſhall conſiſt onely in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar brightneſs of their body, I ſee no ground to determine; becauſe God hath ſo many other ways to crown the faith and love and hope of thoſe whom he delights to honour. It is better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all this diſcourſe with the words of

                     </head>
                     <p>FRom this larger (then was at firſt deſigned) conſideration of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this LIFE, paſs we now to a ſhort Meditation of the ETERNITY of it; which indeed is the Crown that God ſets upon its head, the Circle, if I may ſo ſpeak, which wreathing it ſelf about this Happineſs, makes it to be our ſovereign Good. And it may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy our obſervation, that this <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of Life is as far above the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all other bleſſings heretofore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, as the <hi>Life</hi> it ſelf is. LIFE a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> according to the letter of their Law, ſignifying onely all earthly good things, there was onely a <hi>long</hi> life, not an <hi>eternall,</hi> in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> promiſed to them that kept that Law. But quite otherwiſe, the LIFE pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> conſiſting onely in the enjoyment of ſpirituall and heavenly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:204181:426"/>bleſſings, it is not a <hi>long,</hi> but an <hi>eternall,</hi> never-ending life, in the poſſeſſion of theſe good things, which he hath aſſured to us. It being but fit, that as the Life exceeds that which <hi>Moſes</hi> promiſed; ſo the duration of it alſo ſhould as much out-run his, as <hi>for ever</hi> extends it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond an <hi>Age.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the word ETERNALL may be conceived to comprehend in it theſe <hi>Three</hi> things.</p>
                     <div n="1" type="section">
                        <head>I.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> that there is nothing but LIFE in this ſtate of Bleſſedneſs; which ſhall not be interrupted by any dolefull acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> I told you, in the holy language ſignifie the ſame with <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> and <hi>Miſery:</hi> And therefore the <hi>Eternity</hi> of life muſt include in its notion a ſtate of pure happineſs, of mere and unmixed pleaſure; without any thing that deſerves the name of <hi>Death</hi> to give it the leaſt annoyance. There we may hope to be ſo happy, as to know with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out miſtake, and to be wiſe without fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to increaſe in knowledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our preſent toil to acquire it. Love
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:204181:426"/>is there without hatred, jealouſy or envy, joy without any ſighing or ſorrow, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes without complaints, obedience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reluctance, ſpeed and alacrity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dulneſs and heavineſs; in one word, perfect purity and holineſs, without ſpot or blemiſh to ſully the glory of it. As this lower region of the air we ſee is the place of clouds and darkneſs, thunder and lightning, ſtorm and tempeſt; but to the dwellings of the Sun and fixed Stars none of theſe pitchy vapours aſcend, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure their brightneſs, or trouble their peace: juſt ſo is <hi>this</hi> World the ſcene of miſery and vexation, confuſion and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, our bodies are toſſed with ſeverall ſtorms, and our Souls many times hurried with more violent tempeſts, the fierce guſts of their own paſſions; but when we aſcend to the region of Light, and are cloathed with the Sun, we ſhall be out of the reach of theſe troubles, and find our ſelves in a ſtate of perfect reſt and joy, without the leaſt diſguſt to abate our contentment.</p>
                        <p>And what will make us deſpiſe this <hi>Valley</hi> of tears, if this bleſſed hope have not force enough to lift our hearts above it? Who would not deſire to come to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:204181:427"/>the Mount of <hi>Viſion</hi> and <hi>Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> where we ſhall SEE THE LORD, and be ſo changed thereby, as to be made impaſſible as he is? Let the Readers pardon me, if I ſo far digreſs as to ask them, What is this Wilderneſs wherein you live, that you ſhould love it better then that heavenly <hi>Canaan?</hi> What is <hi>forty</hi> years, or perhaps <hi>ſeventy,</hi> of toil and labour, to that <hi>Eternall</hi> Reſt which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath promiſed? Are not theſe husks contemptible in reſpect of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, <hi>the Bread of life, of which if a man eat he ſhall live for ever?</hi> Is not our life here a dream, a ſhaddow of life, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with this Life that is everlaſting? Why then are you ſo hardly perſwaded to take off your thoughts and affections from things beneath, and not ſo much to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the thorns and prickles that are in all mortall things? Why ſhould we be at ſo much pains to draw you into this Paradiſe, where, as there is a perpetuall Spring, ſo, all joy flouriſhes without the leaſt ſenſe of grief to ſpoil its pleaſures? If you would have us to account you men, we cannot but expect you ſhould entertain this Happineſs; unleſs you can either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe it, or prove it falls ſo ſhort of this deſcription, that it is not worth the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:204181:427"/>price you muſt give for it. But how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able you will be to doe the former, ſhall appear preſently, when I have told you farther, how far ſhort this deſcription is of the incomparable excellency of this Life.</p>

                        <p>For this word ETERNALL ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, may well denote the LIFE we ſpeak of to be without any <hi>intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> as well as without any <hi>intermixture.</hi> As there is no contrary ſenſe of grief in that happy State, ſo there is no inſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of joy.

The life we ſhall lead there will be one continued Act of knowing, loving, rejoycing, praiſing and obeying God; and there will be no void ſpaces wherein we ſhall doe nothing, or wherein we ſhall doe ſomething elſe. We cannot conceive how any drowzineſs ſhould creep upon us, or heavineſs op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our ſpirits: and as for other actions beſides thoſe now named, what ſhould there be, ſince all evill is baniſhed, all ſin ſhut out of that Paradiſe?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="116" facs="tcp:204181:428"/>As for all Good works, there will be none of thoſe, wherein we are now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, to exerciſe our Obedience; as not befitting the Nobleneſs of that ſtate, wherein neither we nor others ſhall be in any need of thoſe things, which now call for our <hi>Charity</hi> to them, or <hi>Juſtice</hi> to our ſelves. What ſhall works of Mercy doe in that world, where there is no Miſery? How ſhall we viſit the ſick, where immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and incorruption provides for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall health? What hoſpitality ſhall we uſe there, where no poor inhabit nor ſtrangers come? How ſhall we cloath the naked, where they are inveſted with a robe of the pureſt and moſt unſpotted light? What Enemies ſhall we ſtudy to reconcile, where univerſall Friendſhip reigns? What differences ſhall we compoſe, where all live in unity and harmonious love? And if theſe works of <hi>Mercy</hi> ſhall be uſeleſs, ſurely then all works of <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi> as they are termed, will be ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. There will be no meat, no drink, no apparell or habitation to be cared for, where there is no hunger, thirſt, and cold, or ſuch like wants, which now continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pinch us. The onely work will be, to think of God, to love him whoſe love will appear ſo wonderfull, to rejoyce in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:204181:428"/>him, to reckon up his benefits, to thank him for them, to perform him ſuch ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as are ſuitable to the dignity of that condition, to love all the bleſſed ſociety, who will contribute all they can to each other's happineſs. And how incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly great will that happineſs be, when we ſhall have no other imployment but to be happy?</p>
                        <p>There are two great defects (as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Divine of our own hath obſerved) which ſpoil the intireneſs of all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights here; but will find no place in the enjoyments of that happy ſtate. For (1.) all the Capacities we have now are ſo narrow and weak, that we cannot long bear any high pleaſure: but we are ſoon ſatiated with it, and are fain, even for our own eaſe, to lay it aſide, and ſeek ſome new delight. This makes our beſt contentments not to be pure and ſincere, without the mixture of ſome dregs; for of other this fleſhly ſtate will not admit. And beſides this, (2.) while we ſtudy the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of one Capacity, another muſt be content to go without the pleaſure that it deſires. They cannot all be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified together, but the reſt muſt wait till one hath done. And, which is worſe,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:204181:429"/>while we fulfill the deſires of the lower Faculties, the nobler commonly are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their ſatisfaction. They that are given to their appetite, and are great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors for the groſſer ſenſes of the body, not onely defraud the Mind, but even the purer ſenſes, (the Eye and the Ear,) which are the great Gates of wiſedome, of their moſt delightfull enjoyments. Nay, ſuch is the imperfection of this ſtate, that the Mind it ſelf cannot eameſtly fix in one ſort of ſtudies, but commonly it is render'd thereby very unapt to reap the delight that other parts of knowledge af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. We have ſeen deep Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours in ſeverall Sciences, prove too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull in matters of common prudence: and others ſtrangely quick in worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, to which they have bent their minds, who have been extreme inapprehenſive of Divine Myſteries. But in the life to come it will be quite otherwiſe; for our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, as I have diſcourſed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapters, will be there mightily improved; and ſo inlarged and widened, that we ſhall be in no danger to take a ſurfeit of the fulleſt enjoyments that can preſent themſelves unto us. And ſuch will be the friendly agreement and ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony between the capacities and deſires
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:204181:429"/>of every faculty there, that the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one can no way turn to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of any other; but rather further and ſet forward its true delight and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For then, the more we know, the more we ſhall love; and the more we love, the more we ſhall know how good God is. And this we ſhall doe without any wearineſs, which now forces us to break off our ſweeteſt enjoyments; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then we ſhall not ſpend, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improve, ourſelves by exerciſe and motion.</p>
                        <p>Which makes another conſiderable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between this ſtate and that which we expect. All our pleaſures here, as you may clearly diſcern from what hath been ſaid, conſiſting in a vehement mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is very tranſient, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlips away; we muſt reſt a while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can renew it, and begin the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again. The duration of the preſent is ſhort; but there are long pauſes made before another ſucceeds. For no man can always eat and drink, or every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enjoy any other delight: much leſs can he always attend to what he enjoys, though the attention is that which makes the delight. But now, quite contrary,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:204181:430"/>this pleaſure that flows from the Viſion of God is of ſuch a nature, that it is always felt and injoy'd. For being firm and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, fixt and unchangeable, like God himſelf, it is not received by piece-meal and at certain ſeaſons, as our pleaſures here are; but is full and all together, without any ſpace between to disjoyn its parts. Which makes thoſe happy ſouls live in one continued compleat hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and joy, which doth not paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but ſtill remains. They can always love him, always praiſe him, always feel a ſenſe of his goodneſs trickling down their hearts, and filling them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable joys without any ceaſing.</p>
                        <p>Who would not then by a ſhort courſe of Piety here, which muſt be oft inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by ſleep and other neceſſary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, (and it is well if not by many failings,) run towards this never-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued life of happineſs in the other world? Who would not wiſh and ſtrive to enjoy ſuch a Good as will never ſuffer him to be out of enjoyment? None, ſure, but they who, though they cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eat and drink and take their pleaſure, yet have their hearts ſo ſunk into ſuch delights, that they cannot receive any
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:204181:430"/>taſte of theſe celeſtiall entertainments. Do but ſpend a ſerious and ſtedfaſt thought upon them, do but give your ſelves a true guſt of them; and you will ſooner ceaſe to eat and drink, then to hunger and thirſt after them.</p>

                        <p>This is the very Crown, as I ſaid at the beginning, and the perfection of the Happineſs we expect. This makes it to be abſolute Bliſs; becauſe it wants not

                        </p>
                        <p>There is nothing we can enjoy in this life, but, beſides that it is ſhort, we muſt attain that ſhort enjoyment by much labour. We muſt not have it with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect eaſe, but with toil and pains and the ſweat of our brows. Or if it come at a cheaper rate, yet it will ſtand us in a great many thoughts, and be paid for with much care and ſolicitude afterward to preſerve our contentments; which elſe will be in danger to be loſt, and leave us the more miſerable. There will be many alſo that envy to us our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and others perhaps that will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to oppreſs us, and deprive us of it. And if we can eſcape all theſe troubles, yet we muſt have a ſore conflict with our ſelves and our ſpirituall enemies: which will put us to great pains to keep our ſelves from being corrupted with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of this world, or poiſoned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the evill examples that are round about us. Therefore this preſent time may well be called the <hi>time of our labours:</hi> after all which there is nothing we have got but muſt alſo have an end
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:204181:433"/>and we ſhall be forced quickly to take our leave of it.</p>
                        <p>But now, in that joyfull <hi>Sabbath</hi> that is to ſucceed, we ſhall reſt from all theſe labours, and be at no more pains to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or keep our happineſs. There will be no danger, as I have ſaid, of our being deſpoiled of it. No Serpent can creep into that Paradiſe, to tempt and allure us from that great felicity: nor ſhall we be in any danger from our own Fleſh; nor find our ſelves in a World where there will be any thing to excite our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but what we may freely take the fulleſt ſatisfaction in. By which, and all the reſt that hath been diſcourſed, you may clearly ſee, there can be nothing wanting to compleat the happineſs of that ſtate, but onely the never-ceaſing dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or continuance of it. Now in this, as was ſaid at firſt, the Reſt we expect in the other world differs from that which God promiſed the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> For by virtue of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law they had a title onely to a <hi>long life</hi> in that fruitfull Country: in oppoſition to which, as well as to our ſhort life here, the Chriſtian Reſt is called an <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:204181:433"/>Life, an inheritance immortall</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe incorruptible) <hi>and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for us.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 4. So our Lord himſelf calls it a great number of times in one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe he had with the ſtupid <hi>Jews, Joh.</hi> vi. where he exhorts them to labour not ſo much for the meat that periſheth, as <hi>for the meat that endureth to everlaſting life, which the Son of man came to give them,</hi> ver. 27. For <hi>this is the will,</hi> he tells them, <hi>of him that ſent him, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life,</hi> ver. 40. And becauſe they were ſtill ſottiſhly regardleſs of what he ſaid, he affirms it again with the moſt vehement aſſeverations, ver. 47. <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, verily I ſay unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlaſting life.</hi> And 58. <hi>He that eateth of this Bread ſhall live for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> which is repeated again in ſundry other places of the ſame Chapter.</p>
                        <p>And I muſt tell you, for your more ample ſatisfaction, that our Saviour hath taken care to deliver this Doctrine to us in ſuch words as can have no other ſenſe or meaning. The word <hi>for ever</hi> or <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi> in the Old Law ſometime ſignifies onely the duration of ſeverall years, or a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:204181:434"/>long compaſs of time, which at laſt might have an end. As the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſervant who had ſold himſelf for ſix years, if when they were at an end he choſe not to go free, he was <hi>to ſerve his maſter for ever:</hi> xxi. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. that is, till the <hi>Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> if his maſter lived ſo long, and he were not redeemed nor releaſed. And there are many Ordinances of <hi>Moſes,</hi> not now to be enumerated, which are ſaid to be everlaſting, becauſe they were to continue till the coming of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now leſt any one ſhould imagine, that the Life our Saviour ſpeaks of ſhall be <hi>everlaſting</hi> onely in the ſame ſenſe, a very long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued happineſs, (ſeverall Ages ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,) which in concluſion might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and come to an end; he hath prevented ſuch thoughts, by uſing other words beſides this of <hi>everlaſting life,</hi> that we may be aſſured it ſignifies more in the Goſpel then it did under the Law, that is, an Endleſs Bliſs. For (1.) he not onely tells the <hi>Jews</hi> in the forenamed Chapter, vi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 50. that he was the bread of which if a man did eat he ſhould <hi>not die:</hi> but that <hi>whoſoever liveth</hi> (that is, every living man) <hi>and believeth in him, ſhall never die;</hi> xi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 26. Which is as much as to ſay, He will give us a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:204181:434"/>Life without any death. And farther (2.) he ſays, that whoſoever keeps his ſaying, ſhall <hi>never ſee death:</hi> viii. 51. Which, if it ſignifie any thing diſtinct from the former, muſt denote that he ſhall never be in any danger of death, or come near it: which, in the next words, verſ. 52. is called <hi>taſting death.</hi> How can this be, ſay the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſince <hi>Abraham and the Prophets are dead; and thou ſayeſt, if a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall never taſte of death?</hi> That's the phraſe wherein our Saviour's Paſſion is expreſſed, <hi>who taſted death</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> lay in the grave a while) <hi>for every man,</hi> ii. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. And therefore may ſignifie here, that our Saviour's faithfull Diſciples, after he hath given them ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, ſhall not die at all; no, not for the ſpace of three days, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they might riſe again. But I have taken notice of one expreſſion fuller then this; for he doth not onely ſay that they <hi>ſhall not</hi> die nor taſte of death, but (3.) that they <hi>cannot</hi> die any more. xx. <hi>Luk.</hi> 36. <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. There is no poſſibility, after they have attained that life, that they ſhould die again; <hi>for they are equall to the Angels, and are the children of God,</hi> being by the Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion begotten to an immortall life.

                        <p>Innumerable Ages ſhall never put a period to this ETERNALL LIFE; but after they are all paſt, the whole Man ſhall be as freſh and beautifull, without any declenſion or ſign of decay, as if it were but newly riſen, and had juſt then put on its pureſt robes of glorious Light. There will be as full a Good, I mean, and as great a ſtrength to enjoy it, and as perfect a liking alſo of it, after millions of ages are ſpent in the heavenly manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as there was at the very firſt entrance
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:204181:435"/>into them. Death being deſtroyed by him who is the Reſurrection and the Life, and who dieth no more; an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Soul ſhall inhabit an immortall Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and they ſhall be <hi>for ever with the Lord.</hi> Where they ſhall be for ever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in thoſe happy exerciſes before mentioned; which will for ever be to be done again. In the doing of them there will be infinite pleaſure; and in the repetition of them there will be no diſreliſh, but an infinite increaſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. As they always know, ſo they ſhall always be knowing more. For new beauties, we may well think, will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves in an infinite object; and this will excite a freſh love, and that a more vigorous joy: And ſo for ever round again there will be knowing, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and rejoycing more and more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any end.</p>
                        <p>It is but a little that can be ſaid of ETERNITY, though we ſhould ſpeak of it to the end of <hi>Time.</hi> Nay, in <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> it ſelf we ſhall not be able to come to the End of it in our thoughts, no more then in our being; becauſe it hath none. We can never know it all, becauſe it is ſtill to come. And therefore how little
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:204181:436"/>of it will this leaf of paper contain? or, ſhould we write never ſo much, how ſhall we be able now to reach the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a thing ſo ſublime? Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acclamations to the goodneſs of our Saviour for bringing life and immortality to light, and ſerious admirations at the amazing greatneſs of what we know of it, will be far more acceptable, as well as more eaſie, then a long diſcourſe about it. And therefore I ſhall end this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with my wiſhes, that this Bleſſedneſs I am ſpeaking of may not ſeem ſmall in our eyes, becauſe we can relate ſo little of it; but rather appear the greater and the more deſirable, becauſe we ſee it is beyond our preſent underſtanding. Though this vaſt Circle of Eternity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meaſured by our thoughs; that makes it but ſo much the more excellent then our Span of time. And though this LIFE comprehend ſuch pleaſures as we cannot now enjoy; that doth but exalt it above the poor pleaſures of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, which we can firſt enjoy, and then contemn. We are not able, it is true, to conceive, nor can it enter into our hearts, what God hath in ſtore for thoſe that love him: but this ſhould onely excite our longings to conceive it;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:204181:436"/>and make us ſigh and ſay, when we think of enjoying God himſelf, and of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall enjoyment of him,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>O the fulneſs of God! O the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him that is the Life of this LIFE! Who can tell what thou art, O moſt Bleſſed for ever; by whom all things were made, and who art All that can poſſibly be? What comforts ſhine from the brightneſs of thy face? How joyfull wilt thou make us with the light of thy countenance, when we ſhall ſee thee as thou art? It will put greater gladneſs into our hearts, then if all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the world ſhould ſmile upon us.</hi>

                        <p>

It caſts us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a trance, when we do but think of being eternally beloved of thee. O what will it doe to feel our ſelves ever, ever, the objects of thy infinite love? The beauteous frame of the Heavens is exceeding admirable in our eyes. O what a goodly World is this, in which thou ſuffereſt thine Enemies to live! What a glorious torch is the Sun, which thou haſt lighted to ſhine on the unjuſt as well as on the juſt! Who then can hope to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:204181:437"/>know, till he ſees, what the pleaſures are which thou haſt prepared for thy Friends? what a glorious Light ſhall ſhine from thy preſence, upon the face of thoſe that love thee? Their hearts now cannot hold the ſmalleſt glimpſe of that which ſhall for ever bleſs and raviſh them with its joys. But how can we hope to ſee it, unleſs thou wilt raiſe us above our ſelves; and make us no longer men of this world, but children of the Reſurrection, and equall to the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? We believe, and rejoyce to think, that thou wilt account us worthy to obtain that World, and the reſurrection of the dead.

                              </note> where we ſhall neither feel any evill, nor want any good? where all our work will be the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, who ſhall be all in all? where no ſloth ſhall make us ceaſe to praiſe him, nor any neceſſity call us to other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? There will be true glory indeed, where no man ſhall be praiſed, either by the errour or the flattery of him that praiſeth. True honour that will be, which ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to no worthy perſon, nor given to any
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:204181:437"/>unworthy. Nay, the unworthy ſhall not ſo much as ſeek it there, where none are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to come but ſuch as are worthy. True peace is there, where nothing ſhall fall croſs to our deſires, either from our ſelves or any other. There He who gave Vertue, will be its Reward; having promiſed that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then which nothing can be greater, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, will be the portion of it. What elſe ſhall we underſtand by thoſe words, I will be their God, and they my people; but that I will be their Satisfaction, I will be all that every one can honeſtly deſire, both life, and health, and ſuſtenance, and riches, and glory, and honour, and all good? For ſo we reade, that God will be all in all. He will be the End of our deſires, who will be ſeen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, and loved without lothing, and praiſed without wearineſs. This will be the office, this will be the inclination, this will be the work of all in that Eternall Life, which is common to all. There we ſhall ſing the mercies of the Lord for ever. There we ſhall keep that truly greateſt Sabbath, which hath no Evening. There we ſhall reſt from labour and ſee, we ſhall ſee and love, we ſhall love and praiſe. Behold what will be in the End without end. For what elſe is our End, but to come to the Kingdom which hath no End?</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the Certainty of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERNALL LIFE, whoſe Excellency is a little farther illuſtrated out of the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WHen I reflect upon the foregoing Meditations concerning the LIFE to come, and the ETERNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY of it, I begin to think I have wrong'd it much, by ſo poor and dull a deſcription of ſo great a Good; and by endeavouring to draw that into a few particular conſiderations, which hath in it innumerable perfections. It had been more becoming our ignorance, perhaps, to have admired its fulneſs, then to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſearch how full it is. Alas! what ſhallow brains have we to contain a wide and deep Ocean? what weak eyes, to look ſtedfaſtly upon the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Light of heaven? How much too ſhort and narrow are our thoughts, to compaſs an Eternall duration? When we
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:204181:439"/>have done all we can, the beſt way, I think, to our ſatisfaction will be, to have recourſe to a paſſage from the mouth of God himſelf, wherein we muſt reſt our ſelves contented. It is in the xxi. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. where St. <hi>John</hi> was told by him who ſat upon the throne, (ver. 5.) that <hi>He that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh ſhall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A moſt marvellouſly-large Conveyance is here delivered to us from him, who hath all that can be in his poſſeſſion. The Great Lord of Heaven and Earth makes us a grant in theſe words ſo exceeding full, that we cannot deſire it ſhould run in more comprehenſive terms. For by this promiſe (1.) He makes over to us <hi>ALL things.</hi> Heart cannot wiſh more to make us compleatly happy, then he ſettles upon us; for there is no good thing that he will withhold from thoſe that ſtedfaſtly adhere to him. And obſerve (2.) the tenure wherein we ſhall hold theſe vaſt and large poſſeſſions, which is as an <hi>Inheritance.</hi> We have an everlaſting perpetuall eſtate made us in <hi>all things.</hi> The terms of this writing are ſuch as if it had run in theſe words, <hi>By an eternall indefeaſible right he ſhall poſſeſs all bleſſings.</hi>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:204181:439"/>For Inheritances, it is well known, among the <hi>Hebrews</hi> never failed, nor went out of the family. They could not be ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated by ſale or gift, but they returned in the year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> to their firſt ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or his poſterity. Which makes the word INHERIT, in the holy lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, to ſignify the enjoyment of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace or poſſeſſion out of which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritour can never be thrown, and which he cannot quit, but ſhall remain ſettled in him to perpetuity. This St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the riches of the GLORY of his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hitance,</hi> i. <hi>Eph.</hi> 18. to ſignify, that our celeſtiall Patrimony is not onely excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding large and firmly ſettled on us; but alſo moſt noble, and brings along with it everlaſting honour and renown. Which is more fully explained, you may note (3.) and the reaſon of it given, in the next words, <hi>I will be GOD to him.</hi> I will confer, that is, ſuch benefits on him, as are fit for the bounty of the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Goodneſs to beſtow. Look what He was to <hi>Abraham</hi> in this world, (to whom he promiſed <hi>to be a God,</hi> xvii. <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.) that he will be to us eternally: <hi>In bleſſing he will bleſs us, and be our excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great reward.</hi>

                        <hi>Genebrard</hi> among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hath well obſerved: and ſignifies as much as the Judge, the Moderatour and Governour of the World, (from whence it is that Judges, Magiſtrates and Rulers are called by this name,) to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to give rewards and puniſhments. And accordingly the <hi>Hebrew</hi> writers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that it is never ſaid the Lord will be <hi>the God</hi> of any perſons, but when he expreſſes ſome ſingularly-great kindneſs, and ſtands in a ſpeciall relation of love to them. In particular <hi>Abarbinell</hi> notes (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Deut.</hi> vi.) that he is never called <hi>the God of Iſrael,</hi> till he had brought them in a wonderfull manner out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the houſe of bondage. I find, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that he promiſed to be <hi>their God</hi> before, when he told <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would give him and his ſeed the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for an everlaſting poſſeſſion. xvii. <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. But he did not begin to be ſo, till he began to lead them thither; and, in token of their being his, they had kept the Paſſeover, and received his Law from Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Before this <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays, <hi>We were bondmen in Egypt, and the LORD

                        <hi>the LORD our GOD;</hi> but onely, <hi>the LORD brought us out,</hi> and, <hi>the LORD ſhewed:</hi> becauſe he ſpeaks of the time before the giving of the Law, which was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt kindneſs he did them after they came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But as ſoon as he had made mention of that, (ſays <hi>Abarbinel</hi>) in the very next words, ver. 24. he alters his ſtyle, and tells them, <hi>The LORD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to doe all theſe ſtatutes, to fear the LORD our GOD, for our good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,</hi> &amp;c. And ver. 25. <hi>It ſhall be our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, if we obſerve to doe all theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, before the LORD our GOD, as he hath commanded us.</hi> And ſo he ſpeaks vii. 1. <hi>When the LORD thy GOD ſhall bring thee into the land,</hi> &amp;c. and ver. 2. <hi>When the LORD thy GOD ſhall deliver them before thee,</hi> &amp;c. and ver. 6. <hi>Thou art a holy people to the LORD thy GOD; the LORD thy GOD hath choſen thee to be a ſpeciall people to himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. For from the time of his appearing on mount <hi>Sinai</hi> and ſo forward (ſays that learned <hi>Hebrew</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)

                     </p>
                     <p>And I think I may as truly obſerve, that till the Reſurrection of our Lord from the dead, (which compleated that <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> departure which <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> diſcourſed with him about, and ſaid he ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ix. <hi>Luke</hi> 31.) we never reade that the Father Almighty is called <hi>the God</hi> of thoſe who believe in his Son <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Then he demonſtrated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all contradiction that he was their Saviour and mighty Deliverer, who would reſcue them from the bondage of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the fear of death, the power of the grave, and give them immortall life. And therefore then he bids <hi>Mary</hi> go and tell his Diſciples, whom he calls Brethren, and ſay to them, <hi>I aſcend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.</hi> xx. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. This is the firſt time he is called <hi>their God:</hi> but ever after there is no language more common. For as St.
<note place="margin">i. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3, 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> call him <hi>the GOD of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> (I ſuppoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had raiſed him from the dead, and highly glorified him for his obedient ſuffering of death;) ſo they addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him as particularly related to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:204181:441"/>them, and ready to beſtow upon them the like bleſſedneſs, ſaying,
<note place="margin">i. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 4. iv. <hi>Phil.</hi> 19. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> iii. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>I thank MY GOD always,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>MY GOD ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all your need: We rejoyce before O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R GOD,</hi> &amp;c. as you may reade in many places of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles. Which ſhews, that this promiſe in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> (made after our Saviour's Aſcenſion,) of being <hi>the God</hi> of thoſe who overcome, includes in it the beſtowing on us the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent benefits. Becauſe he will be our GOD in a more excellent manner then he ever was yet to men: ſuch a GOD as he was to our Bleſſed Lord himſelf. He will prefer us to live with him in great ſplendour and glory. He will give us an inheritance in a better Country, which is an heavenly; where all delights flow, and never ceaſe to ſpring up to thoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Souls, who ſhall enjoy the eternall fruits of his greateſt love.</p>
                     <p>For ſo he adds, (4.) <hi>and he ſhall be to me a Son.</hi> A Son, you know, expects the Inheritance of his Father; becauſe to him it properly belongs, and upon him it deſcends: And therefore to be to GOD <hi>a Son,</hi> is to be made like him, and to live with him in that very happineſs and bliſs which he enjoys. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes it,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:204181:442"/>viii. <hi>Rom.</hi> 17. he ſhall be <hi>an heir of GOD, a co-heir with Jeſus,</hi> who as the Son of God inherits his Glory. He ſhall partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, that is, with God in his everlaſting life, kingdom, honour and joy: which what it is we are not able to tell, no more then we can comprehend what his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty is who poſſeſſes heaven and earth, and is infinite in all perfections. But we have the greateſt reaſon that can be to expect ſo great a bliſs, becauſe we know that <hi>God loves his Son Jeſus, and hath given ALL THINGS into his hand.</hi> iii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 35. We are ſure that God <hi>hath made him moſt bleſſed for ever; He hath made him exceeding glad with his countenance. Honour and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty hath he laid upon him, and his glory is great in his Salvation.</hi> xxi. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>Now it is moſt evident, you may again obſerve (5.) that the generall intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this promiſe is, to put us in hope of being made like to <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Elder Brother. For he is not aſhamed to call us by that name. And this being his great Prerogative, that he is <hi>Heir of all things;</hi> when the Father of mercy aſſures us that we ſhall <hi>inherit all things,</hi> it is as much as to ſay, we ſhall ſhare with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his large poſſeſſions. It is eaſy
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:204181:442"/>to note, how the Holy Goſpell deſcribes our expected felicity in the ſame terms wherein it ſpeaks of that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Head enjoys: with whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays we ſhall <hi>appear in glory,</hi> and <hi>reign with him,</hi> and have a <hi>glorious body</hi> like his, and in order to it be <hi>caught up in the clouds,</hi> (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> iv. 17.) which was the manner of his aſcenſion to heaven, i. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly here God promiſes to him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, that he ſhall <hi>inherit all things;</hi> in conformity ſtill with our Saviour, <hi>whom he hath appointed heir of all things.</hi> i. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>I cannot ſay there is any alluſion in theſe words to the <hi>Olympick</hi> rewards, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Conquerours in thoſe Combats: but ſo it is, that they who overcame there were accounted <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> equall to their Gods; that is, their Hero's or deified men:
<note place="margin">Fabri <hi>Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt. L.</hi> ii. <hi>c.</hi> 11.16, 17.</note> and therefore had Statues erected to their honour, and an annuall Penſion ſettled on them for their more noble main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. But what was this to the reall Divine honour and glory which God will give to victorious Souls? To whom he promiſes not a ſmall Penſion or Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; but an <hi>inheritance,</hi> and that of <hi>all things: i. e.</hi> to ſhine in the glory of our Bleſſed Saviour; who is King of kings and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:204181:443"/>Lord of lords, and can prefer all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to ſuch a greatneſs, that they ſhall be more like Gods then men. So <hi>St. Greg. Nazianzen</hi> often ſpeaks, that

                        <hi>we ſhall be made Gods in the other World, by him that was made Man for us in this.</hi> It is hard to tell what <hi>Heraclitus</hi> meant by that ſpeech recorded in <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi>

                     <p>Let us ſtudy then theſe words very hard, and think often what it is to have ALL THINGS that the love of the Almighty will beſtow, when, in the moſt eminent ſenſe and in another World, he ſhall become OUR GOD: and what it is to have an eſtate in him that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be cut off, but remains as firm as the Throne on which he ſate when he ſpake theſe words. And then, if you believe in him, it will fill you with unſpeakable joy, (without entring into particular enquiries,) to think that you ſhall be
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:204181:443"/>ſo happy as to be his <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Heirs,</hi> who want nothing that can be deſired, or he can give. And indeed theſe other words, ETERNALL LIFE, wherein God's gracious promiſe commonly runs, are of the ſame import and force with thoſe now mentioned. All that we hope for is contained in them. As (1.) <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin:</hi> without which we cannot take one ſtep toward ſo great a bliſs. For death, the fruit and puniſhment of ſin, will ſtill remain, unleſs ſin be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: and then what hope can we have of life, much leſs of Eternall life? which is therefore perhaps called by the name of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> v. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. becauſe it includes our perfect juſtification and abſolution from the guilt of ſin, without which we could not attain it. And (2.) it ſuppoſes the <hi>Adoption of Sons;</hi> which is begun in this life, but not perfected till the next: when we ſhall be made the children of God by receiving a new life from him at the Reſurrection of the dead. And (3.) the <hi>Redemption of the Body</hi> is another bleſſing included in it. For being raiſed again, it will be freed from its preſent weakneſſes, alterations and pains, to which it is obnoxious; and ſtand in need of not ſo much as food
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:204181:444"/>and raiment. And therefore the time when he will beſtow it is called the <hi>day of our Redemption.</hi> iv. <hi>Eph.</hi> 30. To which muſt be added (4.) the <hi>carrying of it up to heaven, to meet the Lord:</hi> For being raiſed a ſpirituall body, it will not be fit for this World, but for the other. Where (5.) we ſhall <hi>reſt with him</hi> in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall Inheritance, and enjoy all the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs it affords: for LIFE, you have heard, ſignifies all good things. And (laſtly) the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of them is plainly expreſſed in the word ETERNALL; which makes the happineſs of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly LIFE appear ſo exceeding great, that our preſent Life, compared to it, is (as <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> ſays of Time in regard of Eternity) no more then a Winter's day.</p>
                     <p>Let this then ſuffice us to know, that we ſhall have a perfect enjoyment of all the Good we are capable to receive, when we are made greater then we are, by the change that ſhall be wrought in us at our departure hence, and at the reſurrection of the dead. And let our pains be more imployed to know the truth and certainty of this, then to know what the Good is we ſhall enjoy;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:204181:444"/>which will be beſt known by poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it.</p>
                     <p>And herein now we may admire the Goodneſs of God, and ſee how liberall he is of his bounties, where we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive them. Though he hath ſaid little to make us particularly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the LIFE of the next world; yet he hath ſaid very much to aſſure us that there is ſuch an happy Life. Where we can underſtand and comprehend his mind, there he fully expreſſes himſelf; and therefore where he is more ſilent, it is (no doubt) becauſe, ſhould he ſpeak of ſuch matters, we cannot underſtand him. We are able to conceive any thing that he ſhall declare for the reaſon of our hope, and the ground of our faith; and it highly concerns us to be very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the foundation of ſuch expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in a future World. And therefore herein our gracious God hath not been ſparing to reveal himſelf; but hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us the ſtrongeſt Evidences for our claim to ſuch an <hi>Inheritance.</hi> Which makes me conclude that, if we were as capable to receive inſtruction concerning the <hi>Inheritance</hi> it ſelf, and to have a <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier</hi> (as I may call it) or particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:204181:445"/>of that heavenly Country, of the manner of their Life, and all the fruits growing there, delivered to us; He that hath been ſo large in the aſſurances he hath given us, would not have denied us alſo this ſatisfaction. Well therefore it is for us, that this is the onely reaſon why we want it, and know not <hi>what we ſhall be;</hi> becauſe we cannot, till we be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, be made partakers of ſo great a knowledge. And well is it for us, that we have alſo ſo good a cauſe to think that this is the onely reaſon; becauſe God hath manifeſted himſelf ſo fully to us in other things that belong to our happineſs, by giving us the moſt firm grounds whereon to build our future hopes.</p>
                     <p>This is the thing which this preſent Treatiſe chiefly intends, to ſhew, as God himſelf ſpeaks concerning the promiſes of the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> xxi. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. that <hi>theſe Words are faithfull and true.</hi> There is no couzenage or deceit in theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, no fraud or colluſion in the drawing them up; nor any alteration in God's mind ſince they were made, and he hath ſet ſuch ſeals to them: But I may ſay, as he there doth to St. <hi>John,</hi> who it's poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble might doubt of what the Angel had

Such, I ſay, is the unqueſtionable credit of the <hi>Words of ETERNALL LIFE.</hi> God himſelf hath ſpoken them; He hath bid us believe them; yea, he hath ſaid, we muſt account him a liar, if we do not rely upon them: For <hi>this,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John, is the Record, that God hath given us eternall Life, and this Life is in his Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before I come to a particular examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that hath been ſaid and done to verify this, let me note theſe <hi>two</hi> things, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the Apoſtle ſaith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="i."/> we have a RECORD of this truth; which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted from the mouth of ſeverall infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Witneſſes, who have depoſed what they ſaw and heard about it, to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all thoſe that will conſider their teſtimony. There being ſuch a RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CORD, that is, that <hi>Jeſus is the Son of GOD,</hi> we have no reaſon to doubt of the <hi>Eternall Life</hi> he promiſes: but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very ſame grounds that we believe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:204181:446"/>the one, we ought to believe the other. If the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and all the other Witneſſes, have proved the former by undeniable teſtimonies; then at the ſametime they proved this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that we ſhall <hi>live by him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For (1.) it is evident that, if <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> ſent by him in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner into the world, to act in his ſtead; we are to believe all that he ſays of himſelf, or that others by his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and authority have declared him to be. Now if we look into his Goſpell, we ſhall find that he moſt earneſtly affirms himſelf to <hi>have been before Abraham was;</hi> viii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 58. and to have had a <hi>Glory with God before the world was;</hi> xvii. 5. and to be ſo <hi>one with the Father, that the Father was in him, and he in the Father:</hi> x. 30, 38. And they who were his inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Witneſſes, whom he ſaid <hi>he would ſend as the Father ſent him,</hi> xx. 21. and who were filled by him with the Holy Ghoſt, declared him to be <hi>God's WORD,</hi> who <hi>in the beginning was with God, and was GOD;</hi> i. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>the image of the inviſible God, the brightneſs of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the character of his perſon; who in the beginning laid the foundation of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:204181:446"/>earth, and the heavens were the works of his hands.</hi> i. <hi>Col.</hi> 15. i. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3, 10. From all which we may certainly conclude, that he is not onely the <hi>Son of God</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Authority, but by Nature; <hi>begotten of him before all worlds, of one ſubſtance with the Father.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
                     <p>We may be confident, (2.) that he being thus nearly related to God, muſt needs know his mind, and be acquainted with his moſt ſecret purpoſes and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: To which he was ſo privy, that he ſays he <hi>was then in heaven,</hi> when he was come down to reveal them to men. iii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. So that we may ſafely look upon the promiſes he makes us of ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NALL LIFE, as the declarations of God's gracious will and pleaſure, which ſhall undoubtedly be fulfilled. <hi>No man</hi> indeed (as St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, i. 18.) <hi>hath ſeen GOD at any time; the onely-begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, which is in the boſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he hath declared him.</hi> For who could dive into God's mind, and tell us what was in his thoughts? What man could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his breaſt, and ſee what was in his heart to doe for us? None but his onely-begotten Son; who being in his
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:204181:447"/>boſome, and privy to his moſt ſecret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, hath <hi>declared</hi> or <hi>expounded him, i. e.</hi> his hidden will and decrees, which elſe had not been revealed to us. It is the opinion of <hi>Maimonides</hi> in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts of his Works
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>L. de Fund.

But there are other of their Learned men, who by his Glory underſtand the Rewards he will give the pious, and the proſperity he ſometimes beſtows on the wicked. Whatſoever it was, God told him he could not comprehend it, but muſt be content with the ſight onely of <hi>his back parts,</hi> not of his <hi>face.</hi> xxxiii. <hi>Exod. ult.</hi> That is, ſaith <hi>Maimonides,</hi> with the knowledge of ſomething of his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; or, as he elſewhere expounds it

To be ſo intimately acquainted with God and his mind as he wiſh'd, was the priviledge
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:204181:447"/>of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> alone, who had the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and fulleſt ſight of the Glory of the Father, both of his Eſſence, and his Will, and his gracious intentions towards us: for he is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>in the boſome</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore <hi>ſees his face,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks; and hath not merely ſome obſcure repreſentations of him, like that of a man when he turns his back to us, but a full view of him in all his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, of which he himſelf is the very Image. And what he ſaw, he hath by God's expreſs will revealed to us; and diſcovered thoſe things which eye never beheld (but were kept ſecret from the foundation of the world) concerning the glorious rewards which his love will give to all pious perſons. For ſince I have proved that he is <hi>his Son,</hi> we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he preſumed to ſay more then he knew, or told us things out of his own mind onely, (when he ſpake of ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NALL LIFE, as he frequently did;) but <hi>what he hath ſeen and heard, that he teſtifieth,</hi> as it is iii. <hi>John</hi> 32.</p>
                     <p>We cannot believe otherwiſe (3.) when we look upon him as the <hi>Son of God,</hi> but that he muſt needs ſpeak the very truth to us. As he could not but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:204181:448"/>know the Mind of God, if he was ſo one with him; ſo he could not but ſpeak to us according to what he knew of his Mind. For as the Father is Truth, ſo is the Son; becauſe he is perfectly the ſame with the Father. <hi>We worſhip the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Truth, and the Son the Truth; who are two in perſon, but one in conſent, and agreement, and identity of will:</hi> as <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>L.</hi> viii. <hi>contra</hi> Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum.</note> ſpeaks explaining thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>I and the Father are one;</hi> x. <hi>Joh.</hi> 30. and, <hi>I am the Truth:</hi> xiv. 6. We may be confident that the words of both are equally <hi>faithfull and true.</hi> So God the Father bad St. <hi>John</hi> write of his own ſayings, as I obſerved before, xxi. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. And in the ſame ſtyle our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him to write of himſelf, <hi>Theſe things ſaith the Amen, the faithfull and true witneſs.</hi> iii. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had ſaid as much before, iii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 34. <hi>He whom God hath ſent ſpeaketh the words of God.</hi> To which the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in another place of that Goſpell, perfectly accord, xii. 49, 50. <hi>I have not ſpoken of my ſelf; but the Father which ſent me, he gave me a commandment what I ſhould ſay and what I ſhould ſpeak. And I know that his commandment is EVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LASTING LIFE: whatſoever I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:204181:448"/>ſpeak therefore, even as the Father ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, ſo I ſpeak.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And (4.) he hath no leſs Power then he hath Truth; but being the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the heir of all things, can make good his gracious promiſes, and put us into the poſſeſſion of the Eternall Inheritance, which we expect as coheirs with him. He was <hi>declared the Son of God with power by his reſurrection from the dead;</hi> i. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. according to his own prayer juſt before he offered up himſelf to God, <hi>Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee: As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternall life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> xvii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
                     <p>And can we think (5.) that he will not faithfully execute this truſt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his power for the end to which it was given him? He would not then be like his Father, <hi>who keepeth Truth for ever:</hi> As he alſo moſt certainly will; being the <hi>ſame Jeſus yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> xiii. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. For if <hi>Moſes</hi> was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the houſe of another, wherein he was but a Servant: no doubt our Lord, who is <hi>a Son over his own houſe</hi> or family,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:204181:449"/>(iii. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.) will not fail to diſcharge his royall office with all exactneſs; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf to be like his Name, <hi>The Word of God,</hi> xix. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. <hi>Faithfull and true,</hi> ver. 11.</p>
                     <p>This RECORD concerning him St. <hi>John</hi> thought ſo weighty and ſecure an evidence, that he concludes all good Chriſtians as ſure of Eternall Life, as if it were already in their hands. For after he had ſaid here, (in the words I am explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) that God hath <hi>given us, i.e.</hi> made us a promiſe of, <hi>Eternall Life, which is in his Son;</hi> he adds immediately, (which is the <hi>Second</hi> thing I intended to note, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="ii."/>) that <hi>we have</hi> eternall life. Which cannot ſignify leſs, then that we have ſuch a good right to it, that we may account it ours. The reaſon is, becauſe he that effectually believes in <hi>Jeſus, hath him</hi> in whoſe power it is to give it, and who hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his word, many a time, that he will beſtow it. So you reade ver. 12. <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life.</hi> He may be as ſure of it as if it were in his preſent poſſeſſion: for by faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> he is united to him who is the fountain and well-ſpring of life and bliſs, and ſtands ingaged divers ways to make all the Members of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:204181:449"/>happy with himſelf. For <hi>to as many as received him he gave</hi>

                        <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>authority, to become the Sons of God:</hi> i. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. who may legally claim the conſummation of their adoption, in the Eternall Inheritance. They are by his grant unqueſtionable heirs of it, and have ſuch a ſtrong title to it, that they can never be defeated of it. <hi>This heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eſtate is in them,</hi> as Lawyers ſpeak, <hi>though they be not in it.</hi> They have an indiſputable right, I mean, to it, and may call it theirs; though they be not yet ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it, and have not taken poſſeſſion; which in due time none can hinder or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar them of. So the Apoſtle would have the Faithfull ſtedfaſtly believe; for this was the very end for which he recorded the Evidences forementioned, that <hi>they might know they have eternall life,</hi> ver. 13. which he repeats often in his Goſpell, as you may reade iii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 36. v. 24. vi. 47. where he aſſerts this in the moſt earneſt manner, and aſſures them that he ſpake of this matter out of certain knowledge, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, verily, I ſay unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlaſting life.</hi> He is a moſt happy man, and may look upon himſelf as owner of more then all this world is worth. Which he can never loſe, though
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:204181:450"/>he be not yet entred upon his inheritance; becauſe it is in the cuſtody of him who hath all power in heaven and earth, and hath ſaid, as it there follows, ver. 54. <hi>I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well then, ſeeing that theſe are the things we expect, <hi>to have our ſins blotted out when the times of refreſhing ſhall come,</hi> to be made <hi>children of the reſurrection,</hi> to be <hi>delivered from the wrath to come,</hi> to have <hi>glorious bodies,</hi> to <hi>reign with Chriſt,</hi> and to be made <hi>heirs of all things;</hi> and ſeeing we are ſaid to <hi>have</hi> this bliſs, <hi>i.e.</hi> to have a certain right to it, if we believe on him; and ſeeing alſo that our right is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent from the ſame <hi>Records</hi> or <hi>Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> whereby it was <hi>proved that Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Son of God:</hi> All that I can apprehend remaining to be done, to give us a fuller certainty of theſe promiſes, is to make particular inquiry what every one of thoſe <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> which teſtify to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſay to this point, that <hi>God hath given us eternall life,</hi> and <hi>that this life is in his Son.</hi> This is the RECORD, St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>i.e.</hi> this is the matter of it. Let us examine, if you pleaſe, all theſe <hi>Six Witneſſes</hi> one after another upon this matter, and ſee if they do not give the ſame evidence of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:204181:450"/>it that they have done of the other; and make as infallible proofs that God hath given us this bleſſing, and that it is in him, as they do that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Son of God, and came from him.</p>
                     <p>There is no way like to this (that I know of) to attain a ſtrong faith and hope of Eternall Life: which it infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us all to make ſure, and to have a well grounded perſwaſion of, both that we may live comfortably in the midſt of all troubles; and that we may be able to overcome all temptations; and that we may be willing to die; and, when nothing elſe will give us the leaſt comfort, we may lift up our heads with unſpeakable joy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For what can deject their hearts,
<note place="margin">Macarius <hi>Hom</hi> xxxiv.</note> whoſe hope is firmly fixt in Heaven? What ſhould make them complain, who have for their Inheritance everlaſting Life? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſpeakable, unconceivable are the glories, innumerable are the good things, which God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for thoſe that love him. As in things vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the plants, the ſeeds, the flowers are ſo numerous that none can count them, nor is it poſſible to caſt up the ſumme of all the other treaſures of the Earth; or as in the Sea, the wit of man cannot comprehend the creatures
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:204181:451"/>in it, either their number, or their kinds, or their differences, or take the meaſure of its waters, or of its place; or as in the Air none can number the Birds, or in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens tell all the Stars: So it is impoſſible to tell or conceive the riches of Chriſtians in the inviſible world; their unmeaſurable, their infinite, their incomprehenſible Riches. For if theſe Creatures are ſo infinite and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible by man, how much more He that made and form'd them all?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>And therefore it ought to fill every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian heart with the greater joy and exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit, becauſe the Riches and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance prepared for them ſo much ſurpaſſes all that can be uttered. And with all diligence and humility ſhould we buckle our ſelves to the Chriſtian Combate, that we may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of their Riches.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:204181:453"/>remarkable, which plainly teſtifie to the Truth of thoſe <hi>two</hi> now mentioned, that LIFE is in his Son, and that we ſhall partake of it.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. That He calls <hi>Jeſus</hi> his SON, and his <hi>beloved</hi> Son. Which being ſpoken from heaven in ſuch a glorious manner as the Goſpell deſcribes it, muſt needs ſignifie him to be his SON in the moſt eminent ſenſe; for it was never ſaid to any Angel in this ſort, <hi>Thou art my Son,</hi> my beloved Son.

Which tells us plainly enough that LIFE is in him: (which is one of the things that St. <hi>John</hi> affirms upon this <hi>Record:</hi>) for elſe he would not be ſuch a Son as he now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him, able to <hi>bleſs all Nations.</hi> Who it is manifeſt had him not for their viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Leader, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> to give them a temporall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; and therefore were to have his ſpirituall Divine Benediction in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, where He is <hi>the authour of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Salvation to all that obey him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And leſt you ſhould imagine this to be merely a collection of mine own, which I have forced out of theſe words, I will refer you to our Saviour's own interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in that ſpeech of his v. <hi>Joh.</hi> 26. <hi>For as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf.</hi> Here he teaches us to argue, that, if he be the SON of God, as this voice ſaid he was, then he is by the ſame voice declared to <hi>have LIFE in himſelf;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Father hath ſo, whom his SON, his onely SON, doth perfectly reſemble. And he teaches us withall, that this is a power communicated to him, as he is the <hi>Chriſt:</hi> for he ſaith the Father <hi>hath given
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:204181:454"/>him</hi> to have life in himſelf, and that (as you reade in the next verſe) becauſe <hi>he is the Son of man;</hi> that is, the great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he promiſed to ſend of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now we reade of no other time when the Father might be ſaid to have <hi>given him</hi> this power, but now, when he owned him for his SON, and anointed him, as you ſhall hear, with the Holy Ghoſt, to preach the glad tidings of immortal life. Now <hi>God the Father ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> and authorized him to be the perſon, to whom we muſt repair for <hi>the meat that endureth to everlaſting life.</hi> vi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 27. He declared him now to be <hi>the bread of God,</hi> as he calls himſelf, <hi>which gives life to the world,</hi> ver. 33. the <hi>bread of life,</hi> ver. 35. <hi>the living bread,</hi> ver. 51. the <hi>manna which came down from heaven,</hi> and nouriſhes to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life: in ſhort, to have all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, that <hi>whatſoever things the Father doeth, theſe alſo,</hi> you may be ſure, <hi>the Son doeth likewiſe.</hi> v. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. He doeth them <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>likewiſe</hi> in this place.) So that we need no more doubt of his ability, then we do of God the Father's, to give eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life to all his followers.</p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:204181:455"/>benefits on them, when he declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be <hi>well pleaſed</hi> in this his dear Son, whom they acknowledge for their Lord and Maſter. He tells us by this voice, that he will be reconciled to us, and, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting our ill behaviour towards him, will eſpouſe us to himſelf (as it follows in the Prophet) in the tendereſt love, and rejoice to beſtow his choiſeſt favours on us.</p>
                        <p>And that this is no inference merely wrung from theſe words, or a notion of my own contrivance, you may preſently agree, if you conſider that thus <hi>John Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſt,</hi> in all likelihood, underſtood them. For ſeeing <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a little after he had ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized him, coming towards him, he cried out, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world.</hi> i. <hi>Joh.</hi> 29. And again, the next day after this he pointed two of his Diſciples unto <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſaid in part the very ſame words, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God,</hi> ver. 36. Now what is it to be the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> but to be a Sacrifice of God's own appointment, ſo pleaſing and acceptable to him, that it obtains all the ends for which it was offered? And what is it to <hi>take away the ſins of the world,</hi> but by overcoming all the temptations to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:204181:455"/>which <hi>Adam</hi> yielded, and being obedient even to the death, to reſtore us unto a right of entring Paradiſe again, from whence our Sins have excluded us? to open the Kingdom of heaven to all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, by removing, as I may ſay, the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Sword; that is, taking thoſe obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles out of the way that debarred us from approaching to the Tree of life? This, no doubt, is the compleat meaning of <hi>Carrying away the ſins of mankind,</hi> which are the onely impediments that hinder us from the enjoyment of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality: and therefore being gone, we have free leave to return to it. Now <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> had no other ground that we can find for this Concluſion, but onely this Voice, which I proved he heard, from the Father, concerning the pleaſure which he took in his Son. Whereby he did as good as affirm, that his delight in <hi>Jeſus, who delighted to doe his will,</hi> was ſo great, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore us into his ancient love for his ſake, and be perfectly appeaſed and reconciled to us by his means: ſo that we ſhould be no longer baniſhed from his bleſſed preſence, but by the forgiveneſs of our ſins be placed again in that happy ſtate, from which we had ſtood ſo long exiled.</p>

                        <p>Now from hence let us paſs to take a review of the <hi>Second</hi> Teſtimony of the <hi>Father</hi> to him; where we ſhall find the ſame thing recorded again, that <hi>He hath given us eternall life,</hi> and that <hi>this life is in his Son; i.e.</hi> it is in his power to give it. The places are well known where we may meet with it, in xvii. <hi>Matt.</hi> and other Evangeliſts, which tell us that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> being on an high Mountain with three of his Diſciples, who were wont to attend him on particular occaſions, was transfigured before them, and a voice came from Heaven, which ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed; hear him.</hi> It would be too tedious to ſpeak of this <hi>Mountain,</hi> and his <hi>Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration</hi> there, in ſuch a glorious manner that his <hi>Countenance ſhone as the Sun:</hi> (though this may reaſonably be thought (as I ſhewed in the former Treatiſe) to be a repreſentation of his Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into heaven, where he ſhines at the right hand of the Father, and is the <hi>Lord of glory.</hi>) And therefore I ſhall onely obſerve two things: <hi>firſt,</hi> the words now added to the voice formerly delivered;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:204181:456"/>
                           <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the manner wherein they were ſpoken in the audience of thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. As for the words now added in this <hi>ſecond</hi> voice to thoſe of the <hi>firſt,</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had declared him, as he doth here again, his beloved Son, in whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted,) they are theſe, HEAR YE HIM. Which are the very words that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when he propheſied of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and ſaid, (xviii. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.) <hi>unto him ye ſhall hearken.</hi> And it may be one reaſon why <hi>Moſes</hi> was now preſent when God ſpake theſe words in the Mount; that he might conſent to this truth which was now ſo ſolemnly pronounced in his hearing, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the Great perſon of whom he had propheſied. Now God bidding the Apoſtles HEAR HIM, and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> himſelf, to whom they had hearkened all this while, being content that he ſhould take his room; it is an argument of ſomething to be declared by him that <hi>Moſes</hi> had not ſpoken. And what ſhould that be, but onely <hi>the words of Eternall Life,</hi> which was but obſcurely intimated and ſhadowed in the ancient Law; but by him was preached ſo clearly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:204181:457"/>that the voice of the Heavens is not more audible?</p>
                        <p>There is nothing, I ſhall ſhew in due place, that our Saviour preached ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, nothing upon which he inſiſted ſo long and earneſtly, and took ſuch pains to ſettle in mens minds, as this belief, that <hi>Eternall Life</hi> ſhall be the portion of all that doe well. And therefore when God the Father bad them <hi>hear him,</hi> who made it his principall buſineſs to publiſh this glad tidings to the World, it was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame as if this Voice had ſaid in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed; believe it, He ſhall give you eternall life.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is <hi>the Commandment</hi> his Father gave him, as you heard before, xii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 50. This is <hi>the will of him that ſent him,</hi> vi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 40. <hi>This is the promiſe that he hath promiſed us, even eternall life,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> ii. 25. And therefore he ſtands engaged to beſtow it, and we agree with him for it when we enter into his ſervice. For you may obſerve farther, that as to <hi>hear Moſes</hi> was to embrace the Covenant that God made with them by him: ſo we can underſtand no leſs by <hi>hearing the Son of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:204181:457"/>God,</hi> then our entring into the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, of which he is the Mediatour; which is founded upon <hi>better promiſes</hi> then the former, whereby we have a title to a celeſtiall, not an earthly inheritance, whereof he is the Lord, and to which he hath engaged himſelf to be our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductour.</p>
                        <p>And indeed <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who were never called the Sons of God, much leſs by a voice from heaven ſo termed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing now with our Saviour in glory, it was a notable ſign that He ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up to a far greater glory then theirs, and have power of changing men into ſuch a condition as that wherein he was now transfigured; and in the mean time ſhould preach that life and immortality, which they ſaw conferred upon thoſe two perſons to honour him.</p>
                        <p>Whom the Diſciples, you may obſerve again, ſaw in a glory ſo much greater then the Law-giver himſelf now had, that if the voice from heaven had been ſilent, it would have been an argument our Saviour ſhould be the Lord of glory. For when they deſired to make their abode there, and for that purpoſe to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:204181:458"/>build three Tabernacles, they ſay, <hi>one for thee, and one for Moſes, and one for Elias;</hi> putting him in the firſt place before the other two: which they would not ſure have done, had not <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> done reverence to him as a greater perſon then themſelves.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall end this with a Tradition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which, if it ſignifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, may ſerve to ſhew that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is their long-expected <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For R. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chai</hi> ſaith

As on the other ſide, God appearing now to our Saviour in a quite contrary manner, on the top of another Mountain, where there was no black cloud, (though it was in the night,) no ſmoak or ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous vapour, much leſs a thick darkneſs hiding him from his Diſciples ſight, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a bright and lightſome cloud which overſhadowed them, and ſhewed them the glory wherein he ſhone; it was a lively repreſentation of the <hi>light</hi> which he <hi>(the Light of the world)</hi> came to <hi>give to them that ſate in darkneſs and in the ſhadow of death,</hi> and of the glory and bliſs whereof he was the Miniſter; unto which he invited mankind in words of grace and ſweetneſs, as he did his Diſciples to ſtay here on the mountain by thoſe chearfull beams wherewith the glory of the Lord ſurrounded them.</p>
                        <p>For this manner of appearing (as I ſaid <hi>Secondly</hi>) plainly ſuggeſts ſome greater manifeſtation of the love and kindneſs, the goodneſs and bounty of Heaven to mankind, then had been made before in that way of revelation to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was ſo much different from the ſweetneſs and amiableneſs of this. When <hi>Moſes</hi>
                           <pb n="182" facs="tcp:204181:461"/>converſed with God upon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> he deſcended thither in Fire, as the places before mentioned tell you; <hi>And the ſight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire, in the eyes of the children of Iſrael.</hi> xxiv. <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. v. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22, 23. But when our Bleſſed Lord took his Apoſtles with him to a ſight of the Divine Glory, there was onely the appearance of a wonderfull bright and chearful light; ſome mild rays from heaven, which had nothing of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in them, but raviſhed them with joy to find themſelves in ſo glorious a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And therefore they were not left at the foot of this <hi>high mountain,</hi> as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> left the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at the bottom of the other; but he <hi>brought them up</hi> with him. xvii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. And they were not put into a fright, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were, who removed their ſtation at the ſight of the fire on mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> nor did they ſhriek, as their Forefathers did there, who cried out, ſaying, <hi>Why ſhould we die? for this great fire will conſume us; if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, we ſhall die. Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God ſpeak with us, leſt we die.</hi> v. <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> 25. xx. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. But they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed out of themſelves with the glory of this ſight; which was ſo inviting to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:204181:461"/>their eyes, that they wiſht for no other ſtation, but deſired to remain perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed there. They were ſo far from running away, that they ſaid, <hi>Let us make here three Tabernacles;</hi> as if they meant to pitch there the place of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, and never take their eyes from ſo beautifull a Light.</p>
                        <p>It is obſervable alſo, that in the dark Mountain where <hi>Moſes</hi> was, together with the fire and thunder and lightnings, there was the <hi>noiſe of a Trumpet exceeding loud;</hi> which made not onely <hi>all the people tremble,</hi> but <hi>the whole mount quaked great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> xix. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16, 18. And God ſpake likewiſe to the people <hi>with a great voice;</hi> (v. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.) wherewith both they were ſo aſtoniſhed as to wiſh never to hear it more, and <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf alſo (ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was the ſight together with the noiſe) <hi>ſaid, I exceedingly fear and quake.</hi> xii. <hi>Heb.</hi> 21. Whereas on the Mountain where our Lord was transfigured there was not one ſuch frightfull flaſh, nor the leaſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſound; nothing but his own gliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Body, the ſplendour of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> the brightneſs of a heavenly cloud, and this one ſweet voice, which proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nothing but love and grace in their
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:204181:462"/>ears, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed; hear him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Matthew</hi> indeed tells us that, when the Diſciples <hi>heard, they fell on their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and were ſore afraid:</hi> xvii. 6. But this doth not ſignify that they were ſeiſed with any horrour at the dreadfulneſs of the ſound; but onely amazed at the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs of the voice, and the marvellous ſplendour of the Light. And therefore the other Evangeliſts do not mention any ſuch terrour after the voice; which, being accompanied with a glory they had never beheld, might well amaze them, but did not make them tremble. The very apparition of Angels was wont to be ſo ſurpriſing as to dazzle mens eyes, and make them bow their faces to the ground. xxiv. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. And therefore ſuch a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſplendour as this, equalling that of the Sun, might well make the Apoſtles fall proſtrate upon the earth, in great fear or amazement. But then our Lord preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came and comforted them by a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous touch, bidding them <hi>ariſe, and not be afraid,</hi> though they ſaw ſuch a light, and heard ſuch a voice as this: to which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they had not been accuſtomed, but was the moſt amiable, and ought to be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:204181:462"/>the moſt welcome, of any that could ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the eyes and ears of mankind.</p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Mark,</hi> it is obſervable, ſays that, before this voice came out of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory, <hi>they were ſore afraid;</hi> ix. 6. <hi>i. e.</hi> were ſo amazed at ſuch an unwonted ſight, or, as <hi>Proclus</hi>

Which Rapture ſeems to have been a foretaſte of the joy which they were to expect, when he ſhould aſcend to that glorious ſtate, which was now repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in his Transfiguration on the Mount.</p>
                        <p>Before I conclude this, I ſhall here take notice, as I paſs to what remains, of ſomething that may help to prove, our
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:204181:463"/>Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the perſon by whom God always intended to ſpeak his mind to the World. For it was at this very time (when the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by reaſon of the terrible ſights and thundring noiſes, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God they might hear his voice no more,) that he promiſed to ſpeak to them by ſuch a Prophet as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in a more familiar manner; requiring them to hear that perſon, when he came and ſpake, as they themſelves deſired. So you reade xviii. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15, 16, 17, 18. where, when they ſay, <hi>Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God, neither let me ſee this great fire any more, that I die not;</hi> the Lord ſaid, <hi>They have well ſpoken, I will raiſe them up a Prophet from among their brethren like unto thee, and I will put my word in his mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak unto them all that I have commanded him.</hi> Which was <hi>perfectly</hi> fulfilled in our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, (whatſoever leſſer meaning it might have before,) who <hi>ſpake the words of God,</hi> and <hi>not of himſelf, but as the Father gave him commandment;</hi> and was a Prophet like to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as in other regards, ſo in this, that he was with God upon the Mount, heard him ſpeak there to theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> his Diſciples, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them as the perſon they ſhould
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:204181:463"/>
                           <hi>hear;</hi> but in a voice ſo ſweet and in a way ſo agreeable, that they did not wiſh never to hear it more, but rather always to be ſo happy, as to have ſuch friendly converſe with Heaven, and receive ſuch tokens of God's Fatherly love.</p>
                        <p>For as the fire and ſmoak and darkneſs, together with thoſe terrible noiſes, were teſtimonies from God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they who would not <hi>hear him,</hi> but tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Laws, ſhould be the objects of his dreadfull diſpleaſure, and be deſtroyed from among their neighbours: So this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall light and brightneſs which ſmiled on them, in the cloud and in his raiment, and in his countenance and in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, when theſe gracious words ſounded in their ears, were moſt manifeſt tokens from heaven of the extraordinary favour of God towards thoſe that obey the Lord <hi>Jeſus;</hi> who ſhall be ſaved from death, and made exceeding happy and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                        <p>The far greater part of the Precepts of the Law being negative, as is evident even from the Ten Commandments, (to ſay nothing of the computation which the <hi>Jews</hi> have made of the whole,) it
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:204181:464"/>abounds more with Threatnings and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full denunciations of Judgement, then it doth with gracious and inviting Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. But moſt of the Precepts of the Goſpell being affirmative, obliging us to doe all the good we can, and to be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in the work of our Lord;</hi> you reade therefore more frequently of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and precious Promiſes to incourage our <hi>labour of love,</hi> then of Threatnings to deterr us from evill doing. And conſonant to this, as that frightfull appearance of old on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was to ſhew God's anger and fiery indignation againſt offenders: ſo this comfortable Preſence now on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent his loving-kindneſs and tender mercy to all obedient perſons. And as the anger of God, declared by the fire and ſmoak, was his inflicting <hi>Death</hi> upon them: ſo his good will, declared by this friendly light and clearneſs in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, is his beſtowing upon us <hi>Life.</hi> And as by the former <hi>Moſes</hi> was noted by God to be the Miniſter of death to all tranſgreſſours: ſo our <hi>Lord</hi> was hereby repreſented as the Miniſter of Life and Righteouſneſs to all that in him live godly.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="189" facs="tcp:204181:464"/>Now that all theſe Obſervations are not the product of mere fancy, but have ſome reall truth in them, this is none of the leaſt arguments; That the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

For God ſpake the <hi>Ten Words</hi> or Commandments out of the fire and ſmoak, before <hi>Moſes</hi> went to ſtay in the Mount forty days; where he onely received the pattern of God's Houſe (which he was to make) and all belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to it, together with the Two Tables
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:204181:465"/>whereon thoſe X Commandments were engraven. All the reſt of the Laws were ſpoken to him out of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, after he had built it: (i. <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.) and we do not find then <hi>the heavens hung with white,</hi> (to uſe their phraſe,) as they were now when he ſpake concerning our Saviour, and bad his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples <hi>hear him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But I intend not to trouble my ſelf with confuting their idle fancies. The uſe that I make of this Queſtion is, That if they would have thought it a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to their Maſter <hi>Moſes,</hi> (did they not ſatisfie themſelves with this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous reaſon for it,) to be ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to after ſuch a manner as the Scripture of truth relates; then, by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, it is a great honour to our Lord and Maſter, and argues his high dignity, that the Divine Majeſty ſpake to him in ſuch a way as they cannot but eſteem moſt perfect, and agreeable to his Divine Goodneſs. And we may look upon this pure Light (in which God is ſaid to dwell) as a ſign that Heaven was to be opened by this Perſon, and that he would reſtore us to the Glory of God, of which we we all faln ſhort; and bring
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:204181:465"/>mankind to that joy and ſatisfaction of heart, which the Diſciples began to feel in themſelves at this moſt comfortable ſight.</p>
                        <p>And I make no queſtion, had not the holy Books told us ſo expreſly, that God ſpake to them in clouds and fire and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, they would have fabled that he appeared to their Maſter in pure light, and ſhone about him in the brightneſs of his glory, without the leaſt darkneſs to obſcure it. For I find that many of thoſe things which the holy Story of the New Teſtament reports in honour of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> or of our Bleſſed Saviour, they have thruſt into the Story of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (where he himſelf in his Books hath not confeſſed the contrary,) to keep him in the greater credit with their Nation in this time of their calamitous deſertion. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recorded, for example, that <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> was born when his parents were very old, and could not believe it was poſſible for them to have a child; (which makes his birth a wonder, being out of the courſe of Nature;) they have made bold to tell the ſame of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (but with a large addition of years,) whoſe mother <hi>Jochebed,</hi> they ſay, was no leſs then an

<note n="*" place="margin">A. Ezra <hi>in</hi> ii. Exod. ver. 1.</note>, is deſirous ſhould paſs for a current truth. And as we reade that, when our Saviour came into the world, the <hi>Glory of the LORD</hi> (an exceeding great light from heaven) ſhone round about the ſhepherds who had the firſt news of it; (which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a note of his Divinity and heavenly deſcent:) So they have devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

                           </gap>, it is all one in exact contemplation of things.</p>
                        <p>Now if the truth of theſe words be throughly examined, how he <hi>had glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him,</hi> and how he <hi>would glorifie him again,</hi> we ſhall meet in both with a plain teſtimony that <hi>Eternall Life</hi> is in his Son, to beſtow on us. Let us conſider them briefly apart.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. As for the former, I find that God had already <hi>glorified</hi> him, before he ſpake theſe words, <hi>three</hi> ways.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. By his Transfiguration, of which I now diſcourſed; for then St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, ix. 32. <hi>they ſaw his glory.</hi> And that by this <hi>Glory</hi> which they ſaw the Father te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified he ſhould be made glorious in the heavens, and able to make us ſo; I refer you to what I have ſaid already on this Argument.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And I need not uſe many words to ſhew, that he had alſo glorified him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:204181:468"/>frequently by the many wonderfull works which he had wrought; for in them it is likewiſe expreſly ſaid, ii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. <hi>he manifeſted forth his Glory:</hi> and the multitude were excited by them to magnifie him with Hoſanna's, and to cry out, <hi>Glory in the higheſt.</hi> xix. <hi>Luk.</hi> 37, 38. By theſe alſo he ſhewed the power wherewith he was indued to doe any thing that he had promiſed: and they moved his Diſciples hearts, as you reade in the place now mentioned, (ii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.) to <hi>believe on him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. But there was a <hi>third</hi> glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, to which I believe theſe words have a more ſpeciall reference; becauſe it was very famous, and but newly paſſed: Which was his raiſing <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> from the dead. By this <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaid expreſly that <hi>glory</hi> ſhould redound to God the Father, and that He, the Son of God, ſhould alſo be <hi>glorified thereby.</hi> xi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. For this very end, he there tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches his Diſciples, <hi>Lazarus</hi> fell ſick, and he therefore delayed to go and recover him, (though his great friend,) that there might be a fit opportunity, by the miraculous reſurrection of ſo noted a perſon, (as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was, it appears by
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:204181:469"/>the coming of ſuch numbers to comfort his ſiſters, verſ. 19.) and in a place ſo nigh to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (verſ. 18.) where the greateſt oppoſition was made againſt him, to doe honour to <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and to make it known, that he aſſumed not more glory to himſelf then God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave him. This was a very great teſtimony from God, that indeed LIFE was in him, and that he did not vainly call himſelf (verſ. 25.) <hi>the reſurrection, and the life;</hi> becauſe he now, with his almighty word, reſtored one to life who had been ſo long dead, that there was no poſſibility of his reviving but by the very LIFE it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Hereby he declared that, <hi>as the Father hath Life in himſelf, ſo he hath given the Son to have Life in himſelf.</hi> v. <hi>Joh.</hi> 26. What he had ſaid before in his preaching, he now juſtified by his works; according as he himſelf foretold he would, when he ſaid, <hi>Verily, verily, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God:</hi> ver. 25. The hour which was then coming, yea was juſt at hand, ſeems to be this time when he raiſed <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> up out of his grave: declaring thereby both the truth of what he had
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:204181:469"/>ſaid, (v. <hi>Joh.</hi> 26.) that <hi>he had life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> and likewiſe that there would be another hour, (as it preſently there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ver. 28, 29.) wherein all men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall riſe out of their graves at his voice, <hi>and they that have done good ſhall come forth unto the reſurrection of life,</hi> as <hi>they that have done evill, unto the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of damnation.</hi> They might well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, becauſe he ſaid it who proved himſelf to be <hi>the Truth,</hi> by ſuch works as none could doe but he that was <hi>the Life.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. But this is not all that we are to conſider in this Teſtimony of the Father; who doth not onely ſay that he <hi>had</hi> glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him, but that he <hi>would</hi> glorifie him again: which was done alſo at <hi>three</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times.</p>

For the very rocks rent, and the earth did quake, and the veil of the temple was torn in ſunder from the top to the bottom, and the Sun refuſed to give its light; and ſuch an amazement came upon the Centurion, who was then upon the guard, that <hi>he glorified God</hi> (xxiii. <hi>Luk.</hi> 47.) by confeſſing that <hi>Jeſus</hi>
                           <pb n="200" facs="tcp:204181:470"/>was <hi>a righteous man,</hi> and no pretender to a title that did not belong to him; but, as other Evangeliſts expreſs it, <hi>the Son of God.</hi> To theſe wonderfull things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring at his death to <hi>glorifie</hi> him and doe him honour, the voice from Heaven ſeems to have had ſome reſpect, becauſe of what follows, ver. 31, 32, 33. <hi>Now ſhall the prince of this world be caſt out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. This he ſaid, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying what death he ſhould die.</hi> For even now, when he ſeemed moſt weak, he began to tread the Devill under his feet. Now he began to draw not onely the <hi>Jews</hi> to him, but other men, the <hi>Romans</hi> alſo; one of whoſe Captains, in the midſt of his reproach, confeſſed him to be the <hi>Son of God.</hi> The very <hi>opening of the graves</hi> ſerved to adorn the triumph he was about to make over the powers of darkneſs; being a ſign that he had now deſpoiled him <hi>who hath the power of death,</hi> which is the Devill; and that he had <hi>Life in himſelf,</hi> and will give it us, eſpecially now that he hath finiſhed his triumph, and is <hi>glorified</hi> at God's right hand.

Which you ſee was as much as to ſay, He would make it appear, even when he hung upon the Croſs, that he was able to open mens graves, and unlooſe the chains of death, and in due time raiſe them up to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.

                        <p n="3">3. Another Act whereby this ſaying <hi>(I will glorifie thee again)</hi> was verified, I take to be <hi>his Exaltation</hi> by God's own right hand to the throne of glory in the heavens. This he prayed for with the greateſt ardency and the moſt aſſured ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, xvii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1, 2. becauſe God the Father, he ſaith, <hi>had given him power</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the promiſe of it) <hi>over all fleſh, that he might give eternall life to as many as
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:204181:471"/>God had given him.</hi> This promiſe, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, was made to him when God uttered this voice from heaven, <hi>I have both glorified thee, and will glorifie thee again.</hi> Then God <hi>gave him a power</hi> to raiſe up all, as he had lately done <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and to give them immortall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: of which as he had then the grant, ſo he now deſires in this prayer to be put in poſſeſſion. And therefore when he ſays verſ. 1. <hi>Father, the hour is come; glorifie thy Son,</hi> &amp;c. I take the meaning to be as if he had thus ſpoke, Now is the time to doe that which thy voice from heaven aſſured me ſhould be done, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>glorifie me</hi> in ſo compleat a manner, that I may <hi>glorifie thee,</hi> and give eternall life to all the faithfull. This he ſpake with <hi>eyes lifted up to heaven,</hi> from whence that voice came, which bare witneſs of him that he ſhould be glorified more then ever, and gave him authority to lay claim to the higheſt power, of beſtowing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>
                        <p>Which power when God the Father had actually put into his hands, according to this prayer and his own promiſe, (of which he could not fail, having ingaged himſelf before a multitude <hi>to glorifie him,</hi>)
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:204181:472"/>then, <hi>being made perfect, he became the Authour of eternall Salvation to them that obey him.</hi> v. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. Then he was <hi>made a Prieſt for ever,</hi> (vii. 16, 17.) <hi>not after the Law,</hi> which was but a weak inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but <hi>after the power of an endleſs Life:</hi> whereby he is <hi>able to ſave them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt that come unto God by him.</hi> He can raiſe up us, and all that ſucceed us, as well as he did <hi>Lazarus</hi> and others: in whom he gave onely a little taſte of his power to give us Life, that ſhall never die.</p>
                        <p>This now is the <hi>Third</hi> Teſtimony of the Father, who, in the audience both of Friends and Strangers, ſaid, <hi>He had both glorified him, and would glorifie him again.</hi> That he <hi>had,</hi> was then very well known; and it was as certain (becauſe he ſaid it) that he <hi>would</hi> doe the ſame again. By the teſtimony alſo of ſufficient perſons it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that he made good this promiſe, even at his Death; after which he raiſed him out of his grave, and lift him up far above all heavens: that he may <hi>be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> once more (2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> i. 10.) by raiſing us up from the dead, and promoting us to eternall glory with himſelf.</p>

                     <p>IF we had no farther Witneſs of this Truth but that which hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready produced, we might well rejoyce in the comfort which God the Father hath given us; and rely upon <hi>Jeſus</hi> as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of <hi>Eternall Life</hi> to all thoſe that obey him. The teſtimony of worthy men, as the Apoſtle here obſerves, is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily received by us: and therefore we ought to be afraid of being ſo rudely prophane as to reject the teſtimony of God; which is of far greater weight then theirs, and hath been ſolemnly given, you ſee, more then once for the confirmation of our Faith. But God the Father, <hi>willing more abundantly to ſhew</hi> (if I may borrow thoſe words in vi. <hi>Heb.</hi> 17.) <hi>unto the heirs of</hi> this <hi>promiſe the immutability of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> hath graciouſly vouchſafed us farther aſſurance; and by his WORD hath

For who is there ſo frantick, as to expoſe himſelf to death for ſuch an unprofitable lie? It is not in the nature of man to ſuffer ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as he did in his own perſon, merely to bring a little falſe honour to another. To fanſy a perſon of his Wiſedom guilty of ſuch madneſs, is a kind of diſtraction in him that ſuppoſes it: who, were he ſober, would be taught otherwiſe by the abhorrence he feels in himſelf to throw away his life for a trifle.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. As for the firſt, the <hi>power</hi> wherewith he is inveſted to give Eternall LIFE, it is viſible from his <hi>ſtanding at God's right hand:</hi> which denotes his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Virtue to effect what he pleaſes. For by the <hi>right hand of God Jeſus</hi> himſelf was exalted to the right hand of power, as you reade ii. <hi>Act.</hi> 33. v. 31. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being placed there, it ſignifies that he can doe for us what God hath done for him; that is, exalt us to the like glory in the heavens where he is. And as this is a clear proof of one of the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:204181:477"/>things here recorded, that <hi>LIFE is in him;</hi> ſo the other,</p>
                        <p n="2">II. That God hath given the faithfull a right to this Eternall LIFE with him, and that he <hi>will</hi> beſtow it on us, is no leſs evident from the very End of this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

This was the purpoſe of the heavenly WORD's coming now to him, that he might not doubt of his promiſes, nor ſhrink in the leaſt from what he had preached, though he ſhould die for it; which would doe him no greater harm then to diſpatch him preſently to the celeſtiall habitations. In the very beginning of his hiſtory we reade, that he had no ſooner heard the Indictment read which they had drawn up againſt him, but, before he ſpake a word for himſelf, the whole Council <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his face as it had been the face of an

And he ſaw alſo the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> as the Crown he ſhould win by his Martyrdom: which had as ſenſible an effect upon his heart for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of his faith and conſtancy, as if he had heard the Almighty call to him and ſay, <gap reason="foreign">

And indeed what could more incourage them, then to hear ſo holy a man departing the world with theſe words in his mouth, <hi>I ſee the heavens opened, and the Son of man ſtanding at the right hand of God?</hi> This was a notable Teſtimony which the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly WORD gave, that he was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of ETERNALL LIFE; whereby he animated this bleſſed Martyr, from what he ſaw Him enjoy, to doe as He had done. Which could have no force in it to perſuade him, unleſs his meaning had
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:204181:479"/>been, that he ſhould no ſooner leave the World, but aſcend up thither where he was. And ſo St. <hi>Stephen</hi> underſtood it; for as they were ſtoning him (the greateſt puniſhment the <hi>Jews</hi> could inflict) he called upon our Saviour, ſaying, <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, receive my Spirit.</hi> vii. <hi>Act.</hi> 59.

Fear not therefore thoſe that go about to ſtone thee; they do but rear thee a lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, againſt their wills, to heaven. Do not fear them; the ſtones will be but as ſo many ſteps to that bleſſed place where thou ſeeſt

                        <p>With ſuch thoughts as theſe this good Man laid down his life: which is as great an argument as any of this nature can be, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> both can and will give <hi>Eternall Life</hi> to his followers. For elſe a perſon ſo full of Wiſedom that they were not able to diſpute with him, (vi. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.) would not have ventured his life, and endured the worſt of deaths, having nothing to comfort him in his agony but onely the hope he had from <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that he would <hi>receive his Spirit.</hi> This was it that gave him ſuch boldneſs and full aſſurance of faith. With theſe words in his mouth he would have died, but that he pitied thoſe who did not ſee as much as he did. Which made him expire in prayer for his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutours; wiſhing them no worſe, then that they might not be hindred by this ſin from believing in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and going thither where he hoped preſently to be received.</p>

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:204181:480"/>to prove, the great love of our moſt Bleſſed Lord would not deny it.

Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will carefully obſerve what he was, and how far, as I ſaid, from any ſuch thoughts, and how deſperately he had been lately ingaged againſt St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and now was proſecuting other of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples, will eaſily conclude that he had
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:204181:481"/>now a reall ſight of the Majeſty of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> at whoſe feet he fell; whom otherwiſe no man ſhould have deſpiſed and blaſphemed more then He.

Which plainly declared him to be the King of Glory, cloathed with the Majeſty of God, and poſſeſſed of an heavenly Kingdom; and therefore <hi>able</hi> to give ETERNALL LIFE to his ſervants: which is one of the things that St. <hi>John</hi> here ſaith God hath teſtified to us.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:204181:481"/>had been to no purpoſe, unleſs this Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition had ſomething remarkable in it, to prove that he was what he pretended to be in his life-time, the Son of God moſt High, whom, according to his word which he paſſed by a voice from heaven, <hi>he had glorified, and given him power over all fleſh.</hi>

And yet he reports this for a certain Truth from the mouth of <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf, who bad him (as he relates this glorious Viſion to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> a Prince well skilled in the Law,) go unto the Gentiles, <hi>to open their eyes,</hi> (as He had done his,) <hi>to turn them from darkneſs unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God; that they might receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and INHERITANCE among them that are ſanctified by faith in him.</hi> xxvi. <hi>Act.</hi> 17, 18. And accordingly he went and preached every-where, in obedience to this heavenly Viſion, the comfortable doctrine of the Reſurrection and Eternall Life, to us Gentiles as well as others: <hi>witneſſing both to ſmall and great that,</hi> as the Prophets had foretold, <hi>Chriſt ought to ſuffer, and ſhould be the firſt that ſhould riſe from the dead, and ſhew LIGHT unto the people</hi> (of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is,) <hi>and to the Gentiles:</hi> verſ. 22, 23. By <hi>Light</hi> in the holy language is meant the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:204181:483"/>gladſome diſcovery of God's good will and pleaſure. For as by <hi>Darkneſs</hi> it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes ignorance, ſorrow and heavineſs; ſo by its oppoſite, knowledge, joy and chearfulneſs. And the <hi>Light</hi> which we have by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſufferings and riſing from the dead, can be nothing elſe but the bleſſed hope of immortality. This St. <hi>John</hi> tells us is the <hi>light</hi> of mankind: (i. 4. <hi>In him was LIFE, and the life was the LIGHT of men;</hi> that is, their ſingular comfort and ſatisfaction, which makes their life not to be irkſome to them:) and with this <hi>Light</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> endeavoured to fill the world, that they might all know how much they were indebted to <hi>Jeſus, who brought Life and immortality to light by his Goſpell.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And can it enter into any man's thoughts, that he <hi>would</hi> have ſet himſelf to preach this doctrine of happineſs to us, (which his own people ſo abhorred we ſhould partake of,) if God the WORD had not made him infallibly aſſured of it? Nay, how <hi>could</hi> he have preached it ſo long, unleſs, as he there ſpeaks, he had <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained help of God;</hi> who countenanced his preaching, and approved this teſtimony of his concerning his Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:204181:483"/>mighty power of the Holy Ghoſt? He himſelf alſo teſtified the ſtrong belief he had of the Reſurrection, and of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that ſhall be revealed, by his labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo abundantly as he did in the work of the Lord; to whom he was deſirous to expreſs an extraordinary affection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his grace and love had ſo abounded towards him. He thought he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the leaſt requite his kindneſs; and therefore would not gain one farthing, not ſo much as a bit of bread, by this preaching: But, though he might have lived by the Goſpel, choſe rather to work with his own hands, to ſupport himſelf and thoſe that were with him; that he might win the more Souls to his Maſter, by making Religion without charge to them. A great argument of his zeal to ſerve his Lord, and promote his honour, and of his firm belief of immortall life, where he deſired onely to have his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices rewarded. Which is excellently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the forenamed <hi>Aſterius,</hi> when he ſays, that he refuſed ſo ſmall a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his infinite labours, as a daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for his body, which was ſo often beaten and bruiſed, <gap reason="foreign">

And therefore you may obſerve, that his ſervice was ſo acceptable to our Saviour, that he gratified him here in this world above our mortall condition: and to give him an earneſt or pledge of the good things to come, and the honour ſhould be done him there, he did him the favour to tranſport him into the <hi>Third heaven,</hi> and another time into <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> where he ſaw Viſions and heard words too glorious for him to utter, or us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in this preſent ſtate. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 3, 4.

That he ſufficiently declares his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to doe what he pleaſes, by taking to himſelf that very Name and Title where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God the Father Almighty ſometimes revealed himſelf to the Prophets. You reade in the xli. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. xliv. 6. the Lord, the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his Redeemer, ſaith, <hi>I am the firſt and the laſt:</hi> which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame with thoſe words i. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:204181:486"/>ending, ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. thoſe two being the names of the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt</hi> letters in the <hi>Greek</hi> Alphabet, as <hi>A</hi> and <hi>Z</hi> are the firſt and laſt in our Chriſt-croſs-row. Now if you look farther into this book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> you will find that in this very ſtyle our Bleſſed Lord ſpeaks of himſelf. In the very beginning of the Viſions there recorded, St. <hi>John</hi> heard one call to him with a loud voice, as of a trumpet, ſaying, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the firſt and the laſt:</hi> (i. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.) and turning about to ſee who it was that ſpake to him, our Saviour appeared in the form and ſhape of a King and Prieſt ſhining in glory, as you reade verſ. 12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus he concludes his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation as he had begun: xxii. 13, 16. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I Jeſus have ſent my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to teſtify unto you theſe things in the Churches.</hi> Which is a demonſtrative ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that <hi>Eternall Life</hi> is in him, and that he wants no power to effect any thing he hath promiſed; being equall to the Father Almighty, whoſe Name elſe he would not have aſſumed.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. And if we examine the ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Name, we ſhall ſtill be farther
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:204181:486"/>convinced, that he will undoubtedly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his power to beſtow upon us that Eternall Life which is in him. For when the Almighty calls himſelf <hi>the Firſt and the Laſt,</hi> he either declares that he is the ETERNALL, who gave being to all things, and remains after they are all dead and gone: or elſe, (as <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> underſtand thoſe words in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>) that he is the IMMUTABLE, from firſt to laſt conſtant to himſelf and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. Which is the gloſs of R. <hi>Solomon</hi> upon the words; who refers them to the help and aſſiſtence which God would give to the laſt as well as the firſt of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s children. What he had been to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the ſame he would ſtill be. He had at the firſt taken them to be his people; and therefore in the latter days he would ſtill own them, and ſhew his ſpeciall affection to them.</p>
                        <p>I ſee no reaſon why theſe two expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be thought ſo inconſiſtent, as to exclude one the other; when they may both be very well joyned together. And then our Lord intends by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of this Title, that St. <hi>John</hi> and all the Chriſtian Churches ſhould look upon him as the Eternall God, able to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:204181:487"/>perpetuate his love and mercy towards them world without end; and as alway the ſame unchangeable Wiſedom and Goodneſs, whoſe mind and will is no more alterable then his power, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains as firmly fixed as God the Father Almighty doth. So that look what God the Father now is or hath been, or what himſelf hath ever been to the body of his Church; the ſame He will ſtill continue immutably to our endleſs happineſs. If God the Father was, and is, and will be the <hi>Alpha</hi> or beginning; the ſame is He likewiſe. All things come from him to his Church, of which he is the Founder; by him it ſubſiſts and continues; and he hath ſuch a creative power in him, that he can give all bleſſings, even <hi>Life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> to it. For though we die, yet he is the <hi>Omega,</hi> who remains ſtill in being after all the world is buried in its ruines; and therefore can quicken our duſt and aſhes, and gather them up to himſelf, and make them glorious. God the Father raiſed him from the dead, and gave him glory: and therefore, ſeeing He hath the ſame power, (as appears by theſe titles,) He can doe as much for us, and give us a glorious reſurrection. In this God the Father faithfully fulfilled the promiſes he
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:204181:487"/>had made him, of glorifying him with himſelf: and therefore we may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he will be as true to us, and make good all the promiſes he hath left us for our incouragement in his obedience; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is perfectly ſuch as his Father is.</p>
                        <p>And, to come a little nearer to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation which Rabbi <hi>Solomon</hi> gives of the words of the Prophet, (where this expreſſion is firſt uſed,) our Lord would have us think that, as God the Father Almighty, having begun to ſhew mercy and favour to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> would not fail to go on and continue the ſame kindneſs to the end: ſo He, being likewiſe the ALPHA, having begun, that is, to raiſe himſelf a Church, and to doe great things for it, even to die and purchaſe it with his bloud, would undoubtedly be the OME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GA, finiſh, that is, his own work, and bring that of which he had laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to an happy concluſion; never ceaſing his kindneſs, till he had perfected his Saints in that Life he had begun to beſtow upon them. Or, as he began in this world to raiſe men from the dead, to beſtow upon them other great benefits, to make them very precious promiſes of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:204181:488"/>greater favours, and to ſeal them with his bloud: ſo he would have them reſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he would continue to the end to doe them good, and at the laſt raiſe all his faithfull ſervants from the dead, and take them up to live with himſelf; and in the mean time perform every other promiſe he had made, for their preſent ſatisfaction and ſupport in this troubleſome world. As he died for them, ſo he would have them make account he lived for them; becauſe he is always the ſame, at laſt the very ſame that he was at firſt: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſince he lives, they might expect to live alſo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. But he did not leave them merely to draw theſe inferences themſelves from that great Name whereby he now made himſelf known to St. <hi>John;</hi> but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, after he had told who he was, he more clearly and particularly declares this very thing, that he hath <hi>Life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> For you reade that St. <hi>John,</hi> behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him in ſuch glory, with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as bright as the Sun when it ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in its ſtrength, (which was a ſight too ſtrong for our weak eyes to look upon, i. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.) <hi>fell at his feet, as one dead.</hi> He was as much aſtoniſhed at his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:204181:488"/>preſence, though he knew <hi>Jeſus</hi> loved him, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, while he was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutour of him. Which ſhews that our Lord appeared now in a moſt amazing glory; too ſplendid for the capacity of his beſt Friends to endure long, without the danger of ceaſing to be men. For ſo far were thoſe words which our Lord ſpake from giving him life, that, like to thoſe who heretofore beheld the glory of God, he was more aſtoniſhed at what he ſaw, then comforted with what he heard; and thought, it is probable, he ſhould die preſently and give up the ghoſt. But in this trembling fit <hi>Jeſus</hi> was pleaſed graciouſly to approach, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his right hand on him, bad him <hi>not fear,</hi> nor let that Majeſty of God which he beheld in him caſt him into ſuch a great conſternation. <q>It is true indeed, (ſays he, verſ. 17.) <hi>I am the firſt and the laſt,</hi> as I ſaid before; that is, am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with all the power of God, bearing his Name and Authority: but there is ſo much comfort in this, that it ought rather to have tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee with joy, then ſtruck thee with terrour. For (as it there follows, verſ. 18.) I, who call my ſelf <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the firſt and laſt, <hi>am he that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:204181:489"/>liveth, and was dead;</hi> I, the very ſame perſon who loved thee and the reſt of mankind ſo well as to die for you, and never made uſe of my power to your hurt, am riſen from the dead; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all my ſufferings (ſuch as you muſt endure for my ſake) am alive, as thou ſeeſt, and in a far better condition then I was before, when thou waſt not thus afraid of me. Though in my firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to raiſe a Church I ſuffered death, and laid the foundation of it in my bloud: yet it is apparent I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death, and now live in greater ſplendour then ever.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>If our Lord had ſtopt here, and ſaid no more, this had been ſufficient to convince him of his power to preſent to himſelf a glorious Church; and from the loweſt and moſt afflicted condition, to raiſe it to the greateſt honour here, and to eternall glory in the other world. But he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds for the ſtronger confirmation of his faith, and ſays, <q>
                              <hi>Behold,</hi> more then this, <hi>I am alive for evermore.</hi> I have <hi>Eternall Life,</hi> and can never loſe this power: and therefore thou mayſt believe me when I ſay that I am the <hi>Omega,</hi> whom thou knoweſt to be the <hi>Alpha;</hi> for I can
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:204181:489"/>perfect what I have undertaken, and bring to an happy iſſue all the good I have begun to work for you. The lateſt poſterity ſhall find that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and able to promote them to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting bliſs. Fear not, theſe words are all true, and therefore I conclude them with an <hi>AMEN;</hi> (wherewith I was wont, thou mayſt remember, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm my ſayings;) that thou mayſt reſt aſſured I now ſay nothing but the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain indubitable truth, when I tell thee, I am he that was dead, and now am alive, and that I live for evermore. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </p>
                        <p>And here again it is obſervable, that our Saviour takes to himſelf that very power which is aſcribed to Almighty God by <hi>Hannah;</hi> who ſays in her Song, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> ii. 6. <hi>The Lord killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</hi> Whereby he would ſuggeſt to St. <hi>John,</hi> that all things are committed to his truſt, and are in his power: (for that is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently denoted in the holy language by <hi>Keys,</hi> the badge of a Steward's authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power in a family:) and therefore it is not too hard for him to overcome the great Conquerour of all men, to open the priſon-doors that have been ſo long ſhut and faſt locked, to looſe the chains of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:204181:490"/>death, and overthrow him quite who hath the power of it, that is, the Devill. But this he would have us ſtedfaſtly believe, and therefore immediately bids him (not lie as a man dead, but get up and) <hi>write the things that thou haſt ſeen:</hi> ver. 19. That is, <q>Let my Church know that I am alive, and that I bear the ſame affection to them that I ever had.

                        </p>
                        <p>And we muſt needs confeſs that there is an exceeding great comfort in this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which he gave thus in his own perſon and with his own mouth to this holy Apoſtle; who knows, as he ſpeaks in another caſe, xix. <hi>Joh.</hi> 35. <hi>that he ſaith true.</hi> For hereby we reſt ſatisfied of one part of the Record which is to be proved, that <hi>Life is in Jeſus;</hi> and ſee moreover much reaſon to believe the other part, that <hi>he intends to beſtow it on us.</hi>

He was born of a woman; but ſhe a Virgin: that was humane, this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. He was wrapt in ſwaddling-cloaths
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:204181:493"/>when he was an infant; but ſhaked off the cloaths that wrapt him in the ſepulchre when he was dead. He was laid in a manger; but then glorified by Angels, pointed to by a Star, and worſhipped by the Wiſe men. He was driven into Egypt; but there drove away the errours of the Egyptians. The Jews ſaw no beauty in him; but he ſhone upon the mountain brighter then the Sun, prefiguring the glory to which he ſhould aſcend. He was baptized and tempted, as Man; but he took away the Sins of the World, and got the victory, as God. He was hungry; but fed many thouſands, and is himſelf the heavenly Bread which giveth life. He was thirſty; but gave the waters of life, and made rivers of living waters flow from thoſe that believed on him. He was called a Samaritan, and they ſaid he had a Devill; but he put Devills to flight, and tumbled whole legions of them into the deep, and made the Prince of Devills fall like lightning from heaven. He was ſold for thirty pieces of ſilver; but purchaſed the whole World with the great price of his own bloud. He was led as a ſheep to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but was the Shepherd of Iſrael, and now is of all the World. He was dumb as a lamb before the ſhearers; but is the WORD preached by the voice of one crying in the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:204181:493"/>wilderneſs. He was wounded and bruiſed; but healed every ſickneſs and all manner of diſeaſe. He was lifted up on the tree, and there fixed; but reſtored us to the tree of life, and ſaved the thief who was crucified with him. He laid down his life; but had power to take it again, and the veil rent, the rocks were cleft, and the dead were raiſed. He died; but he gives life, and by death extinguiſhed death. He was buried; but roſe again out of the grave. He went down into hell; but he brought up Souls with him, and aſcended into heaven, and will come again, to judge the quick and the dead, and to examine all ſuch diſcourſes as detract from his glory.</hi>

                        <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> you know that there was a viſible appearance of the HOLY GHOST at our Saviour's Baptiſm: when the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:204181:495"/>Glory came down from heaven, and reſted on him in the ſight of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt; whereby he was perſuaded that this was the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And if we carefully enquite into it, we ſhall find it to have been as clear a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that it is in his power and in his purpoſe to give <hi>Eternall Life</hi> to all his faithfull ſubjects.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. For <hi>firſt,</hi> the very end of its appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring was to inveſt him with the higheſt office and dignity; which from this time he took upon him and exerciſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before he had lived as a private perſon. So you reade x. <hi>Act.</hi> 38. that he was <hi>anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Holy Ghoſt and with power.</hi> Which being a ceremony whereby Kings are created, we are to underſtand that by the coming down of the HOLY GHOST he was appointed our Lord and Sovereign: one part of whoſe office is, to beſtow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on thoſe that doe him good and faithfull ſervice. Now <hi>his Kingdom not being of this World,</hi> as he profeſſed, and as was apparent by his life and death; and yet he conſtantly aſſerting that he was a King, and exerciſing ſeverall acts of Royall Authority, as I have formerly proved; we muſt conclude, that by this

                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> he was deſigned to be a King in the heavens: where he diſpoſes of all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and preferments, and will promote all his loyall ſubjects to the greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and dignities.</p>
                        <p>There is no reaſon to doubt of it, for the <hi>Glory of the Lord</hi> which at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm deſcended on him, ſo as it had never done on any man, was the <hi>Seal,</hi> or, if you will, the <hi>Crown</hi> of God upon him; which markt him to be the Lord of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, from whom we may expect the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Eternall Life. The very opening alſo of the Heavens, at the deſcent of the HOLY GHOST upon him, ſignified as much, (as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> thinks,) and was a plain declaration of the exceeding great favour of God towards us.

Which we may with the greater confidence expect, becauſe the HOLY GHOST, as I obſerved heretofore, not onely came down upon him; but <hi>reſted,</hi> or took up its abode in him. It did not onely overſhadow him, as the Glory of the Lord did the bleſſed Virgin; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending on him ſettled it ſelf in him as its habitation: inſomuch that every day one might ſee the Glory of the Lord ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in him. Thus <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> who was a carefull obſerver of it, relates in i. <hi>Joh.</hi> 32, 33. where he twice takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the <hi>abiding</hi> and the <hi>reſting</hi> of the HOLY GHOST with him.

                           <pb n="253" facs="tcp:204181:496"/>For he that bad <hi>John</hi> baptize, you may farther conſider, told him, that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who had the HOLY GHOST not onely <hi>deſcending</hi> on him, but <hi>reſiding</hi> in him, was He that ſhould baptize men with the Holy Ghoſt. Be a King, that is, in the heavens, and have all power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him; as he would demonſtrate by ſending the Holy Ghoſt upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as now it came upon him. And till that time came, it was as viſible as the Light wherein the HOLY GHOST ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that it did inhabit in him, by the conſtant ſenſible effects of his Divine power every-where. St. <hi>Luke,</hi> as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Firſt Part, remembers how he returned immediately from <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> where he was baptized, <hi>full of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> iv. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. As was manifeſt, not onely from a number of miraculous operations, but from the no-leſs wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wiſedom whereby he ſpake, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ancient Oracles of God. For to this end alſo he was anointed, (and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he exerciſed the authority of a King,) as the very firſt place of the Propheticall Books which he expounded clearly tells us. iv. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18, 19. Where you may note, that the great buſineſs for which he was
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:204181:497"/>
                           <hi>anointed by the Spirit</hi> was, <hi>to preach the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable year of the Lord.</hi> The time of grace, that is, wherein the good will and pleaſure of God was ſhewn to the world; which conſiſts principally in giving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and eternall Life. This he came to proclaim and publiſh with the power of the HOLY GHOST; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all thoſe divine gifts, mentioned in xi. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to qualify him for this high of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: <hi>four</hi> of which belong to the Mind, (and was well repreſented by that lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous body which came down upon him at his Baptiſm,) and <hi>one</hi> to the Will, and <hi>another</hi> to the power of action; viz. <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Counſel, Might, Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>the Fear of the Lord.</hi> He was able on all occaſions to ſpeak moſt divinely, to teach as one that had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to evade all the ſecret plots which his adverſaries had upon him, to ſearch into their very hearts and deſires, to ſhew the ſtraight way to that bliſs which he preached, to foil all the power of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and to raiſe even the dead to life again. Which were evident demonſtrations that the <hi>Spirit of the Lord reſted on him,</hi> and made him the greateſt Prophet that ever was; not onely the Preacher, but the Giver of ETERNALL LIFE.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="255" facs="tcp:204181:497"/>III. For as by this power of the Holy Ghoſt it was manifeſt he <hi>had Life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> ſo God's intention to give this Life to us was apparent from the manner of its deſcent; which is ſaid to have been <hi>like a Dove.</hi> The phraſe, indeed, is dubious, and may ſignify onely, that this glorious Body which came down from heaven was, in its deſcent or falling, like the coming down of a Dove with its wings ſpred abroad. Yet ſince St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith that it came <hi>in a bodily ſhape;</hi> and the Church, though the words do not neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it, hath thus underſtood it; we may moſt probably conclude, the word <hi>Like</hi> hath relation not onely to the <hi>coming down,</hi> but to the <hi>Dove</hi> it ſelf: telling us, that the form or figure of this celeſtiall glory which now appeared, carried the reſemblance of that creature.</p>
                        <p>Now to think that this form was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without any deſign at all, would be very contrary to common reaſon: which leads us rather to conceive, that God would ſhew, at the very firſt entrance of our Saviour upon his office, by this known emblem of meekneſs and love, what great favour and kindneſs he intended to ſhew
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:204181:498"/>to mankind; and with what a tender ſpirit of gentleneſs and ſweetneſs our Lord ſhould exerciſe the Miniſtry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, towards the <hi>poor,</hi> and the <hi>broken in heart,</hi> and the miſerable <hi>captives,</hi> to whom he preached the <hi>acceptable year of the Lord.</hi> Or elſe, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s words are, <hi>He remembers us hereby of the old hiſtory.</hi> For the whole World being once ſhipwreck'd, and humane kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in great danger to be totally loſt, this Creature appeared with an Olive-branch in her mouth, and brought them glad tidings that the tempeſt was over, and that there was now an univerſal calm. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>All which things were a type and figure of what was to come. For now when the affairs of mankind were in a worſe condition, and they were all in danger of a ſoarer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the unſpeakable grace of God in our Saviour ſteps in for our reſcue. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Dove appeared again, not bringing an Olive-branch, but ſhewing us our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer from all evill, and adminiſtring unto us good hopes. For it doth not bring merely one man and his family out of danger, but appeared to lead all the world to heaven; and, in ſtead of an Olive-branch, brought the adoption of Sons to all mankind. And
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:204181:498"/>where the dignity of this adoption is, there is the deſtruction of all evill things, and the gift of all things that are good.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe ſpeaks <hi>Theophylact,</hi> who contracts his ſenſe in fewer words. <q>As the <hi>Dove</hi> brought to <hi>Noah</hi> the news that the waters of the floud were gone; ſo now the HOLY GHOST brought the joyfull news of the doing away of Sin. <hi>There</hi> was an Olive-branch; and <hi>here</hi> was the mercy of God.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> underſtood it, who having ſeen this ſight cried out, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world;</hi> that is, <hi>Death</hi> the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Sin; and conſequently reſtores us to immortall life. i. <hi>Joh.</hi> 29, 30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This, he thought, declared God to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled; and lookt upon it as a token that the heavens had laid aſide their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and would be at peace with the ſinfull ſons of men. The windows, you know, of heaven were opened in the old World; but dark and pitchy clouds were all that appeared, which poured down nothing but a floud of rain upon mankind. Whereas now, quite contrary, when the heavens were opened again, there was no diſmall ſight preſented it
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:204181:499"/>ſelf, but onely a pure light and glorious brightneſs ſhone from the face of God. And the HOLY GHOST in the form of a <hi>Dove</hi> appeared, not like that of <hi>Noah</hi> after the deluge had ſwept all mankind (very few excepted) from the face of the earth; but, to give notice to the World, that God would not take ſuch vengeance upon men for their wickedneſs, but be graciouſly reconciled to them, by ſaving them from death, and giving them the bleſſing of Eternall Life. One might well gather as much from this ſight; eſpecially when there was ſuch an <hi>Olive-branch</hi> of peace (if I may ſo call it) in the mouth of this Dove, as that voice from heaven which came along with it, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> One of theſe illuſtrates and explains the other: and both of them tell us, that the heavens now look upon us with a ſerene countenance; and that we are no longer ſhut out of them, but God is ſo well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that he will admit us into thoſe celeſtiall habitations.</p>

                        <p>This was farther declared afterward, when the Apoſtles, according to his
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:204181:499"/>promiſe, were on the day of Pentecoſt <hi>baptized with the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> whereby they were ſent by him, as he was by the Father. Then the Heavens poured down ſuch a large ſhowr of the Divine grace, as preſently overflowed the World with a comfortable ſenſe of ETERNALL LIFE. This was one great end of the coming of the HOLY GHOST, which then <hi>witneſſed</hi> to our Saviour, and openly ſhew'd him to the World as the <hi>Prince of life.</hi> iii. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</p>
                        <p>For, (1.) it was a plain demonſtration that He whom the <hi>Jews</hi> had murthered was alive from the dead; and had not loſt his power, which was ſo eminent in him all the while he was on earth, to doe good, and beſtow benefits upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And (2.) the greatneſs of the benefit ſhews that he was greater in power then ever, having ennobled all his Servants, and raiſed men of the loweſt condition to the higheſt dignities, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing on them the gift of the HOLY GHOST. It was <hi>his</hi> gift, as he fore-told in his life-time, when he ſaid, <hi>I will ſend the Comforter from the Father;</hi> xv. <hi>Joh.</hi> 26. and, <hi>He ſhall receive of mine, and ſhew it unto you:</hi> xvi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14, 15.

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:204181:500"/>the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> declared <hi>his</hi> greatneſs and power over all; as St. <hi>Peter</hi> diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the very firſt Sermon he preached after our Saviour's reſurrection on the day of Pentecoſt. ii. <hi>Act.</hi> 33. Where he tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> that what they ſaw and heard, and were amazed at, was ſhed forth and poured on them by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who had now received the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt. And <hi>therefore,</hi> ſays he, ver. 36. <hi>let all the houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made that Jeſus whom ye crucified both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, You ought to look upon this as an undoubted argument that he is Lord of all things, (the <hi>Chriſt</hi> or King whom God the Father hath appointed,) becauſe he hath ſent ſuch royall gifts to his ſervants as none but the Lord of the world could poſſibly beſtow.</p>
                        <p>And by the way we may take notice, that the better ſort of the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves expect the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould bring ſuch grace to men. For <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> in the place fore-mentioned, acknowledging Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous works to be a note whereby the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall be known, reckons this for one of them, <hi>the effuſion of the Spirit of God</hi> ſpoken of by the Prophet <hi>Joel.</hi> Our
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:204181:500"/>Lord therefore ſending this down in a plentifull manner on the day of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt, thereby manifeſted, if they would have ſeen it, that he had the mark of their King upon him; and indeed could doe that which they all confeſs is the Work of God alone, who onely can pour out the gifts which the Prophet there promiſes. There is no reaſon to queſtion the power of ſuch a King as this, to doe what he pleaſes; even to prefer his ſubjects to his heavenly Kingdom. They may be raiſed, when he thinks good, to reign with him above; as now they began to doe upon the earth. It depends upon his will alone to exalt them to that very place, from whence this mighty power of the Holy Ghoſt came down upon them.</p>
                        <p>But that we may be ſatisfied the HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY GHOST was an expreſs Witneſs of his being the <hi>Prince of life,</hi> (a King that hath Life in himſelf,) <hi>a Prince and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> (as it is v. <hi>Act.</hi> 31.) who can deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men from the oppreſſion of all their Enemies, the greateſt of which is Death, you may conſider, (3.) that the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous change which was wrought on a ſudden in the minds of very ignorant men,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:204181:501"/>is an evident argument what he can doe for our Souls in the other World. He inſpired them with ſuch Underſtanding by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, that the greateſt Doctours in <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not able to reſiſt the Wiſedom whereby they ſpake. They underſtood clearly all the ancient Prophecies: There was no veil or cloud any longer upon them, but the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> made them ſee the whole My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery which was wrapt up in them. It revealed all Types; explained all Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; led them into the Sanctuary and Moſt holy place; ſhew'd them the true meaning of the Mercy-ſeat; and laid all thoſe things, which did but obſcurely point at ETERNALL LIFE, ſo open and naked, that none could chuſe but ſee, if he did not ſhut his eyes, they were not the ſame men that they had been but juſt before, and were made thus learned without any humane helps of inſtruction. A convincing argument of his power to raiſe our Minds when we depart this World, and have not the clouds of this Body before our eyes, to as great a pitch of knowledge as I diſcourſed of in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Treatiſe. And the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs of this change was as clear an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that he can doe it without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:204181:501"/>and that there is not ſo great a diſtance between this preſent ſtate and that which we expect, but he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tranſlate us to it.</p>
                        <p>And (4.) this Knowledge, you may conſider farther, being accompanied with a mighty Power, whereby the Holy Ghoſt inabled them not onely to give eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, health to the ſick, but life alſo to the dead, (as was very well known in thoſe days) was an undoubted teſtimony, that He from whom it came is able alſo to <hi>change theſe vile bodies, and make them like to his own moſt glorious body.</hi> For it is viſible he hath a power, whereby he can <hi>ſubdue all things to himſelf.</hi> To take away life, you may think is no ſuch great matter, that we ſhould take any notice of it: yet to doe even this with a word for lying to the HOLY GHOST, was an argument of a mighty power reſiding in the Apoſtles. And when <hi>Abarbinell</hi> ſpeaks of the power of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to work Miracles, from that Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xi. he alledges theſe words to prove it; (verſ. 4.) <hi>He ſhall ſmite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips ſhall he ſlay the wicked.</hi> Which was never
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:204181:502"/>literally fulfilled during our Saviour's ſtay on Earth; (where he did nothing but good to men;) but was made good after he went to Heaven by his power in his Miniſters, who ſmote that wicked couple mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> v. without any hands, merely with the breath of their mouth. What ſhall we think then of their reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men to life after they were dead; for which they were more notorious? We cannot but look on this as a great wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the wonderfull power of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in them; and conſequently of the life and glory he intended to beſtow on ſinfull duſt and aſhes. He would not have filled them thus full of his Spirit, if he had not meant thereby to raiſe their expectations above all that even by its power they at preſent felt. Had it not been his deſign to make them hereafter like to God, he would not have preferred them to ſuch a reſemblance of his Wiſedom and Power here in this World. They that could raiſe others from the dead, had no reaſon to doubt of being raiſed up themſelves. When they ſaw themſelves made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyers of ſuch great bleſſings to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; they muſt needs ſtand fair, they could not but conclude, for a very large portion of his favour to their own perſons.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="265" facs="tcp:204181:502"/>For the truth is, (5.) theſe gifts which were then given to men proclaimed aloud the marvellous bounty of our Saviour, as well as his power: and would not let them doubt of a far more glorious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it in the other World, then they ſaw, and were the inſtruments of, in this. And if any imagine that, though this might be a teſtimony to <hi>them</hi> of Eternall Life, yet it is none to <hi>us;</hi> the contrary will ſoon be evident, if you do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, (6.) that our Lord having made a promiſe of <hi>Eternall Life,</hi> not onely to his Apoſtles, but to all that believe on his Name; the HOLY GHOST puts us in ſtrong hope of it, by demonſtrating his faithfulneſs to his word. For the Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it was the performance of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which he had frequently made when he was with them; both before his death, (xiv. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter,</hi>) and after his Reſurrection, xxiv. <hi>Luk.</hi> 49. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I ſend the promiſe of my Father upon you,</hi> &amp;c. i. Act. 4, 5. <hi>Being aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jeruſalem, but wait for the promiſe of the Father, which, ſaid he, you have heard of me: For you ſhall be baptized
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:204181:503"/>with the Holy Ghoſt, not many days hence.</hi> And therefore we have great reaſon to look for the promiſe of Eternall Life with much confidence, becauſe He who made it was ſo faithfull and juſt in fulfilling his former promiſe, at the time appointed. Eſpecially ſince he thereby demonſtrated, that he hath ſufficient power to doe for us according to his word. For he who made ſuch an extraordinary change in them on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> that they were able in an inſtant to ſpeak all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, to propheſy, and underſtand the ſecret counſels of God, can change us, we need not queſtion, from glory to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and at laſt transform us ſo perfectly, as to make us like to himſelf.</p>
                        <p>And I may adde, to ſtrengthen this conſideration, (7.) that our Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he would ſend the HOLY GHOST for this very purpoſe, that they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the reſt of his holy promiſes; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly this great one, of <hi>Eternall Life.</hi> Which is the meaning of that which you reade in xiv. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. where after he had told them (ver. 9, 10, 11.) that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them and ſhew'd himſelf in the Works that He did, which demonſtrated that <hi>the Father dwelt in him,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:204181:503"/>that he would <hi>go and prepare a place for them, and take them up to himſelf,</hi> he adds theſe remarkable words; <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, He that believeth in me, the works that I doe ſhall he doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and greater works then theſe ſhall he doe, becauſe I go unto my Father.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <q>Mark now what I farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to you, and rely upon it as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth. The works that I have done are ſufficient to convince you: but for a greater confirmation of your faith, that <hi>I am going to the Father,</hi> and am <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> I tell you, that after I am departed theſe wonderfull things ſhall be repeated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of the world, by thoſe that believe on me. Nay, ſome things ſhall be done which your eyes have not yet ſeen; <hi>becauſe I go to my Father, i. e.</hi> have power in the Heavens, and have reſerved ſomething peculiar to be given as a teſtimony of it, over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what I have done my ſelf.</q> And that was their ſpeaking with all tongues on a ſudden, and their propheſying; whereby they were inabled to preach to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as he had done to the <hi>Jews</hi> alone, and work the ſame wonders among the heathen, which he had wrought onely in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:204181:504"/>that Country. A marvellous evidence this was of the power and glory of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to give <hi>eternall life;</hi> in that being abſent he did thoſe things by his Apoſtles, which were not performed whilſt he was preſent with them.</p>
                        <p>And therefore (8.) upon this account the HOLY GHOST thus given to the Apoſtles, and thoſe that believed by their word, is called <hi>the earneſt of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in their hearts, untill the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 22. i. <hi>Eph.</hi> 14. It was ſomething given them in hand, before his ſecond appearing for full redemption, to aſſure them they ſhould as certainly receive all that was behind, as they had already received this pawn and pledge of his mighty love.</p>
                        <p>And indeed we have all much reaſon to think that he will doe very great things for us when he appears in his own perſon, (as the Holy Ghoſt aſſures us he will, iii. <hi>Act.</hi> 19, 20.) ſince he hath done ſo much good to the world by the Apoſtles, his Deputies, who were men like to our ſelves. If his Servants brought ſuch bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to men, then what will the Lord himſelf bring with him at his coming?
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:204181:504"/>If his Miniſters reſtored dead men to life again; the Maſter ſure will beſtow a life as much excelling that which they reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as he excells his Officers. In ſhort, if the people lookt ſo earneſtly on two poor Fiſher-men, when they had cured a man lame from his mother's womb; iii. <hi>Act.</hi> 12. much more will the Lord of glory draw the eyes of the world to him, by doing aſtoniſhing things for his people; <hi>when he ſhall come</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> i. 10.) <hi>to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.</hi> 
                           <q>He will give ſuch a glory to us, as will be much for his own credit, and reflect glory on himſelf. He will not ſo much conſult what is fit for us to receive, as what is fit for ſuch a Prince as he to give. He will cloath us with ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, that it will be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him to have his followers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in ſuch rich and ſhining liveries. It will ſet men into admiration to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the bounty of his royall favour to them; and much advance the greatneſs of this Prince, to ſee ſuch ſubjects at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, the meaneſt of which are Kings.</q> Nor do we ſtrain our fancies, and exalt our hopes above what we can reaſonably expect, when we look for ſuch
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:204181:505"/>high dignities: for that we ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into his heavenly Court, and be thus ſumptuouſly apparell'd, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently entertained by Angels to wait upon us, and carry us to him, we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the teſtimony of the HOLY GHOST: which cloathed poor men here with a power greater then the moſt abſolute Monarch on earth ever enjoyed; and enabled them to deal greater and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher gifts to men, yea, to ſcatter them abroad every day as they paſt along the ſtreets, or did but ſpred their ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow over them, then Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours could doe at their Coronation, or Conquerours at their moſt magnificent Triumphs.</p>

                        <p>And as a farther proof of this, we muſt obſerve once more, that the HOLY GHOST gave its teſtimony of the <hi>Life</hi> that is in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſhall be given to us, when it fell down upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of believers, as it had done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtles: who were not deſirous to keep the miraculous gifts of it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone, but readily communicated them to others. It was a great wonder
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:204181:505"/>to hear the Apoſtles ſpeak with tongues and propheſy, to ſee them cure the lame, and reſtore the blind to their ſight, nay, raiſe the dead to life, onely by bidding them live and be well in the Name of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> (things which no Potentates on Earth, as I ſaid before, could beſtow, though they were forward to take to themſelves the name of Gods, and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Divine honours:) But it was a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wonder, to ſee other illiterate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians receive the ſame gifts by the laying on of their hands, and invocation of the Name of the Lord <hi>Jeſus;</hi> who preſently filled them with the HOLY GHOST.</p>
                        <p>This was a thing ſo ſtrange, that they could not but look upon it as a token of the moſt extraordinary Love of God to mankind; from whence they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect as much happineſs as the word E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERNALL LIFE, I told you, imports. For, (1.) nothing ever diſcovered the capacity of humane Souls ſo much as this effuſion of the HOLY GHOST: which ſhew'd how large and wide they are, and how much they can contain, and to what degree of excellence they may be improved and raiſed, and that on a ſudden, by the power of God. This
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:204181:506"/>gave them a ſtrong taſt of what was to come; and both made them reliſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall life above all other things, and alſo put them in hope to attain it, by the favour of that perſon who had promoted them to ſuch a ſight of it, in this vaſt meaſure of wiſedom and love wherewith they were indued. For, (2.) it could argue nothing leſs, they might very well think, then that they who wore ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent marks of his favour, as to have a Crown of life and glory ſet upon their heads in <hi>this</hi> world, ſhould be raiſed to far greater honours in the <hi>next,</hi> when they ſhould be more capable of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and nearer to himſelf. And indeed, (3.) ſince hereby he dwelt in them, and they became the <hi>Temples of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> they might be confident he would not ſuffer ſo holy a place to be pulled down, but in order to the building of it better. And ſince the Holy Ghoſt alſo (4.) won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully inlarged their hearts, and made them exceeding deſirous as well as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall in conveying ſuch exceeding great benefits to others; they could not but look upon it as an undeniable argument of the moſt bounteous goodneſs of God; who is far more inclinable to doe good then Men can be, and more ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:204181:506"/>our ſervices then we can be to doe our work.</p>
                        <p>And conſidering moreover (5.) the promiſe he had made of ETERNALL LIFE, the gift of the Holy Ghoſt was a marvellous earneſt of it, and a kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it in their Souls. What? ſhall an ignorant Sea-man be made a Prophet, and ſpeak with all tongues? a poor Tent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker unlock Myſteries, and indite ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Songs and Hymns? a man that ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday could mend nothing but his Nets, now cure a man of a bloudy-flux, or mend a lame leg? a rude Souldier command Devils, and ſtorm his ſtrong holds more eaſily then a town without walls? Lord, what light is this, might they juſtly ſay, which ſhines in our dungeon! what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is this wherewith we ſee frail fleſh armed! what might which thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to graſs and hay! As well may a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfly think of mounting up to heaven, or a flower attempt to pluck up a cedat, as we poor wretches conceive a thought of effecting ſuch wonderfull things. This ſure ſignifies that men are very dear to God, or elſe he would not thus dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. It may well make us believe there is nothing ſo great, nothing ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:204181:507"/>promiſed by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but he will work it for us; having already transformed us into ſuch noble creatures. As <hi>Manoah</hi>'s wife ſaid to him, xiii. <hi>Judg.</hi> 23. <hi>If the Lord were pleaſed to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meat-offering at our hands, neither would he have ſhewed us ſuch things as theſe:</hi> ſo might they in this caſe ſay, and with greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage then ſhe, If the Lord would let us ſtill remain under the power of death, he would not have <hi>given</hi> ſuch gifts into our hands, (for that is more then to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> the poor oblations we make to him,) nor would he have revealed ſuch ſecrets to us. He would not have ſent us the ſpirit of wiſedom and knowledge, nor raiſed us to the degree of prophecy, nor put new tongues into our mouths to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his wonderfull works, nor made all diſeaſes ſubmit to our word. All which gifts, with divers others, they had reaſon to look upon as the <hi>earneſt of the Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Seal</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, whereby they had an aſſurance given them (as I hope to ſhew elſewhere) of the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting inheritance which <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the heavens. For they demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that He who had power thus to alter and advance mean men, and to make
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:204181:507"/>them <hi>Stuporem mundi</hi> the wonder and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement of the world, could alſo give that <hi>Life</hi> which he had promiſed, by that very power which they felt already wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in them.</p>
                        <p>And they alſo made it evident (6.) that he would beſtow it. For there is no more reaſon that he ſhould thus beſtow the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> at preſent, then that he ſhould hereafter give us <hi>Eternall Life.</hi> His faithfull promiſe is the ſecurity for both; our hopes are built upon that ſure foundation. If there be any difference between the ground there is for one more then the other, the advantage lies on the ſide of the hope of <hi>Eternall Life.</hi> Which there is more reaſon now that he ſhould give us, then there was for giving the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> even becauſe he hath already done ſo much for his Church: and there is more reaſon we ſhould expect it; becauſe, as I ſaid before, we have ſeen a remarkable inſtance of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, in pouring out ſuch <hi>rivers of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving water,</hi> when he ſent the Spirit which he promiſed.</p>
                        <p>And here it comes to my mind,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>in</hi> xi. <hi>Iſa.</hi>
                           </note> that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Wonder, which <hi>Abarbinell</hi> ſays
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:204181:508"/>the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall work at his coming, is a Miracle like that of dividing the Red ſea when <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Which he endeavours to prove from xi. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 15. <hi>The Lord ſhall utterly deſtroy</hi> (or <hi>dry up</hi>) <hi>the tongue of the Egyptian Sea,</hi> &amp;c. that is, ſays he, of <hi>Nile,</hi> the great River of <hi>Egypt.</hi> This our Lord hath done more excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then they imagine. For it was nothing near ſo great a wonder, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be <hi>baptized into Moſes in the Sea;</hi> as it was, that the people who followed <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould be baptized into him with the Holy Ghoſt poured down upon them from heaven. The paſſing through the <hi>Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Cloud</hi> to boot, was not ſuch a certain argument, that <hi>Moſes</hi> would bring them out of the great affliction wherein they had been plung'd, and lead them to <hi>Canaan,</hi> their reſt and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; as theſe <hi>rivers of living water,</hi> the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and the admirable effects thereof, filling the world with the <hi>Glory of the Lord,</hi> were an undeniable proof to thoſe who were under its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the perſon who would lead them to a better reſt, in a more heavenly Country, which flows with far ſweeter delights then milk and hony. This did, as it were, dip their ſouls into
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:204181:508"/>this belief, and made them ſenſible that <hi>Jeſus is the Authour of Eternall Salvation;</hi> far more then the Sea it ſelf could baptize their forefathers into <hi>Moſes, i.e.</hi> perſuade them that he was the Prophet of God who would deliver them, and bring them to the peaceable enjoyments they deſired.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, I obſerve, after the <hi>Jews,</hi> who quarrelled at St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to the Gentiles, were ſatisfied that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> was faln upon them, even as upon themſelves, they had no more to ſay but this, <hi>then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</hi> xi. <hi>Act.</hi> 18. This they lookt upon as the beginning of God's favour and loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs to them, which would conclude in nothing leſs then the ETERNALL LIFE of which we are diſcourſing. And ſo this very Apoſtle St. <hi>John,</hi> after he had put the Diſciples in mind of the UNCTION they had received, and exhorted them to continue in that <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine</hi> which it taught, (Chap. ii. of this Epiſtle, 20, 24.) immediately adds that <hi>this is the promiſe which he hath promiſed us, even Eternall Life,</hi> ver. 25. Which was as much as to ſay, that the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> by the HOLY GHOST had ſo perfectly
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:204181:509"/>inſtructed them in the certainty of this great happineſs, that it was ſufficient to move them to abide in the Doctrine of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> none being able to teach them better, or to put them in hope of any thing greater then this ETERNALL LIFE which he promiſed, and by the HOLY GHOST aſſured.</p>
                        <p>It is true indeed, which ſome are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to object, that we in theſe days ſee not ſuch evidences as thoſe Believers had; the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> not inhabiting thus in every one of our Souls as it did in theirs. Nor is there the like reaſon it ſhould; we being ingaged in no ſuch hard ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices as theirs, which ſtood in need to be incouraged with the ſtrongeſt hopes of a glorious reward. They were <hi>in deaths often,</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks,) and therefore were in danger to faint, without a moſt lively guſt of immortall Life. The whole World was their enemy, and with the greateſt rage oppos'd their preaching; which required a clearer ſight of the World to come, and a more ſenſible deſcent of inviſible powers for their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence and ſupport. From whence we alſo derive no ſmall benefit: becauſe the more ſenſible demonſtration they had of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:204181:509"/>it, the firmer grounds of hope are laid for us; whoſe faith relies upon their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and the power of the HOLY GHOST in them. This is ſufficient to hearten us in our duty, that our Lord hath given to thoſe, whoſe teſtimony we have the greateſt reaſon to believe, ſuch viſible and palpable evidences of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive, and of his intentions to quicken his ſervants to Life everlaſting with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Let us but heartily apply ourſelves, upon theſe grounds, <hi>to live by the faith of the Son of God;</hi> and we ſhall find the ſame Spirit that wrought in them opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in us alſo, to confirm our Faith and Hope, and make us <hi>rejoyce in hope of the glory of God.</hi>

                        <p>And ſo much may ſuffice to have been ſaid of the <hi>Witneſs</hi> of the HOLY GHOST, which perfectly agrees with the other two of the FATHER and of the SON: <hi>who are all one,</hi> you ſee ſtill, <hi>in their Teſtimony, as well as in their Nature.</hi> So I expreſs'd my ſelf in the Concluſion of my former Diſcourſe about theſe <hi>Three Witneſſes</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. iv. <hi>pag.</hi> 235.</note>; ſuppoſing theſe words, though few, would have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently teſtified my right belief in the Holy
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:204181:510"/>Trinity; and that none would have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, I waved the farther explication of that paſſage, THESE THREE ARE ONE, becauſe I entertained a ſenſe of it differing from that of the Catholick Church. I was not conſcious to my ſelf of any ſuch Hereſy; and therefore had no reaſon to be ſolicitous to prevent this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, by diverting from the ſubject I had in hand, unto another Argument.

                        <p>If we would but always lay before our eyes theſe Records, and were as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them as we are with our Evidences for our Eſtates; if they were as freſh in our minds as the words of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord which we are to plead in ſome Court, where we have a Cauſe to be heard, or the Title to our whole Eſtate tried and determined; I do not ſee how we ſhould poſſibly doubt of this Promiſe which our Lord hath made to his followers, nor how we ſhould loſe the joy and comfort of it in this world of ſorrows. Let all thoſe who have taken the pains to reade thus far in this Treatiſe be ſo kind to themſelves, as on all occaſions to recollect what they have read, and in their quiet thoughts to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:204181:513"/>put themſelves often in mind, that the <hi>Father</hi> hath ſaid this is true, by a voice from heaven at ſeverall times: when <hi>Jeſus</hi> was baptized, when he was upon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mount, and before a multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, He teſtified that ETERNALL LIFE is in him. The <hi>Word</hi> alſo hath ſhewn us this glorious State, when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to his beloved St. <hi>John;</hi> who have all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated their knowledge to us, and told us that he aſſured them He lives, and that we ſhall live by him. The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> likewiſe hath declared this, by coming down upon Him, and upon his Apoſtles, and upon his faithfull ones. And then they cannot chuſe but rely moſt firmly upon ſuch ample and unqueſtionable Teſtimonies; and be very much affected with this <hi>full aſſurance of Faith</hi> which God works in us. There would be no reaſon, I am ſure, why they ſhould not as ſtrongly believe and expect the glory that <hi>Jeſus</hi> will give us, though they do not now ſee it; as we all do the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the promiſe of any perſon of known honeſty and ability, though at a great diſtance from us. No doubt the faith of Chriſtians would be immovable, did they ponder theſe things; they
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:204181:514"/>would never call it into diſpute, after ſuch demonſtrations, whether there be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life or no. Yea, they themſelves would become <hi>immovable, and ſtedfaſt, and abundant in the work of our Lord;</hi> becauſe the very ſame Witneſſes tell them that this is the onely way to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Happineſs, which cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by any means but by patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in well-doing.</p>
                        <p>How well then would it be with them, could we but prevail with all Chriſtian Souls to ſpend ſome time eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, in calling to mind what they have heard theſe <hi>Heavenly Witneſſes</hi> ſay? If they would but caſt up their eyes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning towards heaven, and think, There <hi>Jeſus</hi> is; there he lives in great honour and glory; there he ſits at the right hand of the Throne of God; there St. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw him; in ſuch glory St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> beheld him; from thence they heard him ſpeak, and make moſt gracious promiſes to them; he ſent the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> from thence to be his Witneſs; there he is preparing a place for all them that have the heart to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him; thither he will receive our Spirits to behold his glory; and with
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:204181:514"/>him ſhall all good men live for ever in unconceivable joy: How would theſe thoughts inſpire and raviſh their hearts?

How mean and contemptible would our pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty injoyments, which now ſo tempt us, ſeem in compariſon with that divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? How impoſſible would it be to perſwade us to yield to the breach of any of his commands, and thereby for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit ſuch happineſs? Yea, how eaſy, ſweet and pleaſant would it be to doe as he bids us, in hope of ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable recompence?

                        <p>It is reported by him that writes the Life of <hi>Laurentius Juſtinianus,</hi> that when he was a youth, about nineteen years old, which is an age you know moſt ſlippery and ſubject to danger, he thought he ſaw one day or night (I know not well whether) a very beautifull virgin approaching towards him, and thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing her ſpeech to him: <q>Why doſt thou, O young man, thus diſquiet
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:204181:515"/>thine heart, and waſt thy ſtrength, in a vain purſuit of many things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thou poureſt forth thy affections? why doſt thou ſeek for reſt in ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall injoyments? That which thou art ſo deſirous of, is in my power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon thee. And if thou wilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolye to take me for thy Spouſe, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to bring with me ſuch a portion of peace and contentment, as no other perſon can inrich thee withall.</q> The young man, you may well ſuppoſe, was much taken with ſo rare a feature, and ſuch fair promiſes; which moved him to crave that he might know her name, and the family from which ſhe was deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. To which ſhe anſwered, <q>
                              <hi>I am the Wiſedom of God;</hi> that is my Name, thence is my Parentage: if thou wilt accept of the offer, I will be thine, and give all I have to thee.</q> The youth, ſays the ſtory, inſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and after he had drawn a contract between them, thought ſhe took her leave of him, and went away to provide for the wedding. Upon this he awaked, and imagined the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion inſtructed him to betake himſelf to a Monaſticall life. Which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vowed; concluding that in that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:204181:515"/>retirement he was to compleat his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the <hi>Wiſedom of God,</hi> when he had quitted the empty pleaſures of the World.</p>
                        <p>However fabulous this Story may prove, (which ſeems to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in imitation of that Viſion of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> which many <hi>Greek</hi> Writers menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) you may make it true if you pleaſe. For, behold how the true Wiſedom of God, our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour, preſents himſelf to you. He hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in moſt admirable beauty and a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious form to many of his Servants, which they have deſcribed and left us the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of. In his Goſpell he is ſo lively expreſſed, that we cannot, if we look upon him, but behold him as <hi>the onely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begotten of the Father, the brightneſs of his glory, and the character of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> Would it would but pleaſe you to liſten to the offers he makes you, the portion of Life and Glory hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, together with true peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment here, which he will aſſure to you. O that you would but draw a lively image of theſe things in your mind; and repreſent the King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as ſoliciting your heart to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice!
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:204181:516"/>Do you not believe that it would be infinitely more obliging, then ſuch an apparition as that now na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? Would it not more eaſily make you abandon the ſinfull pleaſures of this world, then the other made him forſake the lawfull? Would not the beauty of our Saviour, and the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his glory in the heavens ſet before your eyes, be more inamouring then any imaginary or reall beauty whatſoever? Would not theſe words of his be more piercing then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>I will give to him that overcomes, to inherit all things;</hi> and, <hi>I will be his God, and he ſhall be my Son?</hi> Would it not tranſport our hearts with joy, to hear that he will be contracted to us; and aſſure us of ſuch a dowry with himſelf in the heavens? Would it not make all his commands ſo far from being grievous, that we ſhould think them ſweet and delicious above all the pleaſures wherein ſenſuall men are drowned? He can make no doubt of it, that hath not loſt his reaſon; and is able to underſtand what the difference is between ſuch a certain truth as this, and a dream; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the commands of our Lord, and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:204181:516"/>the obedience which that youth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to perform.</p>

                           <hi>Jeſus</hi> is certainly in the heavens, He ſits at the right hand of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty on high, He unfeignedly wiſhes we would be eſpouſed to him, He will ſettle an eternall inheritance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: and He doth not require us to go into Monaſteries and deſerts, to live like Hermites and Anchorets, to immure our ſelves from all ſociety; (though if he did, we ſhould have no ill bargain of it;) but onely to retire ſeriouſly into our ſelves, and there often meet with him, to live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteouſly and godly while we are in the world, to let no company draw us from his precepts, nor ſuffer any creature to rob him of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And what a reaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand this is, you will then ſee, when you heartily believe this ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NALL LIFE which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. <hi>Believe,</hi> and then you will think there is nothing too much or too hard to be done or ſuffered, for the attaining ſuch a glorious Life with our Saviour. Which moved St. <hi>Stephen</hi> to ſuffer ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be in deaths often,

                        <p>And let us with honeſt hearts, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be what God would have us, beg the aſſiſtence of the HOLY GHOST to guide us in this way of underſtanding; which we ſhall find incomparably the beſt, to ſettle in our mind a ſenſe of the happineſs to come. <hi>For when the Soul comes to the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit,

                     <p>YOU have ſeen already how many there are that ſolicit our affections, and perſwade us to believe in the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and heartily conſent to him in whatſoever he requires. So many, that how we ſhould deny him, after He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath appeared ſo often with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of <hi>Eternall Life,</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> have commended him to us as the Prince of Peace and the Lord of Glory, it is harder to give any reaſon, then it is to prove that he is the Son of God, and that in him is ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NALL LIFE. For, as if theſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were not ſufficient, or that we may be born down by numerous Teſtimonies, there are <hi>Three</hi> more, who are our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, (as I may ſay) with whom we are well acquainted, and whoſe witneſs none could ever deny, that ſpeak the very ſame

                        <p>And as for the <hi>Purity</hi> and Holineſs of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> there is much in it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, that he hath Life in himſelf, and will beſtow it upon his Followers. Certain it is that, (1.) it naturally lifts
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:204181:520"/>up the Mind towards heaven, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thoſe that entertain it to look for <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Life;</hi> for which it is but a preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For it teaches us to abſtract our hearts from this Fleſh wherewith we are cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and from this World wherein we live, as not worthy of all thoſe thoughts and that care which we are apt to beſtow upon them. The very intent and purpoſe of it, we cannot but ſee, is to wean our minds from earthly injoyments, and to take off our affections from the pleaſures of ſenſe; to make riches and the praiſe of men ſeem little things, and to give us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment with our portion of preſent goods, though never ſo ſmall; in ſhort, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o render us ſomething like to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whilſt we are at this diſtance from him. What can any man make of this, but that it is a preparation for another life; an Inſtitution which deſigns to form men, and make them fit for an higher World? Do but take a review of that Compendium which I have drawn of this Doctrine, in my former Book, and you will be ſatisfied, that it is nothing elſe but a contrivance to make us heavenly; and intends to guide us to ſuch a Life as is a prevention of Heaven, a beginning of the celeſtial ſtate, whereby we ſhall live,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:204181:521"/>in part, as men of another World, and not of this.</p>
                        <p>Which future World, (2.) it is manifeſt, his heavenly Doctrine ſuppoſes; or elſe it would be ſo far from that Wiſedom which was eminent in him, that it would be the greateſt abſurdity that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. For it teaches us, if his ſervice require it, to deny our ſelves even in the moſt innocent and lawfull injoyments of this life; to forſake father and mother and houſes and lands for his Name's ſake; yea, to lay down our very lives, rather then forſake his Doctrine, and violate his commands. Theſe are expreſs Leſſons which his Sermons teach his Diſciples: but are things ſo ſublime, ſo much above the reach of fleſh and bloud, that it would be the vaineſt thing in the world to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to mens obſervance, without the hope of ſomething in another life to reward ſuch hard ſervices. He would have had no followers on theſe terms; had he not made it as plain and evident as the reſt of his Doctrine, that He would be the <hi>Authour of Eternall Salvation</hi> to them that would obey him. Men were not ſo fond of troubles and torments and death, as to expoſe themſelves to the danger of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:204181:521"/>them, if they had not ſeen the greateſt reaſon to believe, that their Maſter would recompenſe their preſent Sufferings with a future happineſs ſo incomparably greater, that it would be the higheſt folly to avoid them. None can ſuppoſe the Authour of ſuch a Religion to be ſo weak as not to underſtand, that men would never em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this profeſſion; unleſs at the ſame time that he called them to this high pitch of piety, he <hi>called them</hi> alſo, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks, <hi>to his kingdom and glory.</hi> And therefore, without all doubt, our Lord took care to preach this as the principall thing, and to give good aſſurance of a bleſſed ſtate to come; becauſe without this it had been the moſt ungrounded and fooliſh undertaking that ever man went about, to perſwade the world to be ſo mortified, to quit all preſent poſſeſſions, and to part with their lives for his ſake. He muſt have been the moſt unreaſonable of all other men in preaching ſuch Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and ſuppoſed the World void of all reaſon, if he expected to have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; had he not been certain himſelf, and been able by evident proofs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade others, that all thoſe who hearke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him ſhould be no loſers, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great gainers, by quitting all
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:204181:522"/>things upon his account. If he had not held this truth in his hands, as clear as the Sun, that they who would follow him ſhould be immortally happy; he might have ſtretcht them out long enough before he had drawn ſo much as one follower af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. The Trees would as ſoon have followed him as Men: who would never have ſtirr'd a foot in ſuch a narrow path, unleſs he had ſhewn them plainly that it led to Everlaſting Life.</p>
                        <p>Let us conſider and illuſtrate this a little. Would not he expoſe himſelf to laughter and ſcorn, that ſhould earneſtly perſwade his neighbours to go and labour hard in his fields all day, by which they ſhould get juſt nothing for their pains at night? Would it not ſeem a piece of ſtrange mockery and contempt of <hi>us,</hi> and as ſtrange a folly in <hi>him</hi> that ſhould invite us to enter into his ſervice, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed would make us ſweat, and ingage us in many toilſome imployments; and when we inquired what wages he gave, ſhould be able to aſſure us never a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that lay in his power or will to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon us? Would they not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ridiculous, he that ſhould make, and they that ſhould embrace ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall?
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:204181:522"/>Might not ſuch a trifler expect rather to be kickt, then to be followed by the multitude? Should we not hear them expreſſing their indignation in ſuch ſpeeches as theſe? What? Do you take us for arrant fools? Do you think we are mere Muſhromes? that our brains are made of a ſponge, or our heads ſtuft with wet ſtraw? What do you make of us? or what have we done, that argues us to be ſuch blocks and trunks as you ſuppoſe us? And yet ſuch was the conſtant preaching of our ever-Bleſſed Saviour, that if he had not made his promiſes as plain and certain as his commands, he would have been lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuch language. For he calls men, as you reade in that Parable xx. <hi>Matth.</hi> to a laborious life of piety. From the beginning of his preaching to the end of it, he had no other deſign. <hi>Early in the morning,</hi> (verſ. 1.) when he firſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the world, <hi>he went out:</hi> and what was it to doe, but <hi>to hire labourers into his vineyard?</hi> At the <hi>third hour</hi> he went out again, and ſaid to thoſe whom he found idle, <hi>Go ye alſo into the vineyard:</hi> (verſ. 4.) At the <hi>ſixth</hi> and the <hi>ninth</hi> hour of his life he ſtill followed the ſame bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. At the <hi>eleventh</hi> alſo (verſ. 6.) he finds other loiterers, and ſays to them alſo,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:204181:523"/>
                           <hi>Why ſtand you here all the day idle?</hi> Would they have moved from their place, think you, if he had not <hi>agreed with them</hi> to pay them for their pains? Would they have returned no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer but that, <hi>No man hath hired us;</hi> and not have alſo added, What will you give us? what ſhall we gain by our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? had he not ſatisfied them about that matter? If there had been no wages to be expected, they had better have ſtood idle ſtill, or have ſtaid for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maſter. Had it not been evident, that the Lord of the vineyard was a weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſon, able to give <hi>every man his peny, i. e.</hi> a reward for his ſervice; he might have called long enough, and ſeen his ground all overrun with briars and thorns, before he had procured any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers to go into it. Certainly, if we will but allow our Saviour to have been a perſon of ordinary reaſon and common capacity, we cannot imagine he would have endured ſo long toil and travell, and walkt all the countrey of <hi>Judaea</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to win proſelytes to him; if he had not made it as viſible, that he would bring men to the bleſſed ſight of God in eternall reſt and peace, as it was, that he called them to a God-like life of piety,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:204181:523"/>righteouſneſs and true holineſs during their ſtay in this preſent world. We muſt depreſs him into the rank of the moſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs men; or elſe believe that He who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſo much work from his ſervants, demonſtrated he was a good Maſter, rich, and furniſhed with the moſt ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                        <p>And therefore (3.) we may well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that He <hi>came</hi> with ſuch Teſtimonies from above, from the <hi>Father</hi> and from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and intended <hi>Himſelf</hi> to appear from heaven as the Authour of Eternall Life; without which he could not have gone about to eſtabliſh ſuch a Doctrine; or if he had, would not have ſucceeded. One of theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly juſtify the other; and are not to be divided. We have reaſon to think, a perſon of his Underſtanding, <hi>who ſpake as never man ſpake,</hi> (his very enemies being judges,) would not have attempted the ſettlement of ſuch a ſtrict rule of life as his Doctrine contains, without ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from Heaven as I have mentioned, to perſwade the world that he would lead them thither. Though I muſt add, (4.) that the ſtrict purity and holineſs of his Doctrine ſingly conſidered is of great
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:204181:524"/>weight and moment to perſwade us that ETERNALL LIFE is in him: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is a part, nay, a principall part, of his Doctrine. Which He, who in all other things that he ſaid was unrepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, would not have affirmed ſo expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſtantly, if he had not been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured it was true.</p>
                        <p>Do but obſerve how this Doctrine is conſtantly intermixed with all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. It is the very ſtrain of his Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that if any man would follow him, and doe as he did, he ſhould find reſt for his Soul; and that God <hi>the Father</hi> of all <hi>would honour thoſe who did him ſervice.</hi> xii <hi>Joh.</hi> 26. This he proclaims in the plaineſt terms, and the cleareſt manner. viii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. <hi>I am the Light of the World:</hi> (<hi>Illuminator &amp; Deductor humani generis,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> excellently expreſſes it
<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Apolog. cap.</hi> xxi.</note>, the Inlightner and the Conducter or guide of mankind:) <hi>He that follows me ſhall have the light of life;</hi> the wiſedom, that is, which ſhall lead him to immortall blifs. And to make this more manifeſt, let it be noted, (1.) how he proclaims this to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, iii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15, 16. that the Son of man muſt die, <hi>that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternall
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:204181:524"/>life. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely-begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> And (2.) he aſſerts it with the greateſt earneſtneſs, with the ſtrongeſt and moſt vehement aſſeverations. vi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 47. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlaſting life.</hi> He tells them alſo (3.) with the ſame aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that God <hi>had ſealed him</hi> for this purpoſe; or ſet a plain mark upon him, whereby all might ſee that he was to be the Authour of everlaſting life. vi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 27. And obſerve (4.) that, having told them it was viſible, if they pleaſed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their eyes, that God the Father had deſigned him to give them immortall ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, he repeats this Doctrine a great many times in that Chapter; verſ. 33, 35, 39, 40, 47, 48, 51, 54, 57. Inſomuch that St. <hi>Peter</hi> concludes at the latter end of that Sermon, there was no Maſter compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to him, who had <hi>the words of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life:</hi> ver. 68. And it is farther obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that he affirms (5.) he came to bring his followers to the greateſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. x. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</hi> And (6.) that he tells them again, he came to publiſh this glad tidings
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:204181:525"/>
                           <hi>by the appointment</hi> of the Father. xii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 50. <hi>I know that his commandment is life everlaſting: whatſoever I ſpeak therefore, even as the Father ſaid unto me, ſo I ſpeak.</hi> And (7.) that he affirms, he hath power to make good what he promiſes. x. <hi>Joh.</hi> 28. <hi>And I give unto them eternall life; and they ſhall not periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hand.</hi> xvii. 1, 2. <hi>Glorify thy Son, as thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternall life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> And, <hi>laſtly,</hi> he tells them that he was ſuch a perſon as might well be credited in all this; ſince he <hi>came down from heaven,</hi> and <hi>was at that moment in heaven.</hi> iii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. Which he repeats again viii. 23. <hi>I am from above, I am not of this world:</hi> and ver. 38. <hi>I ſpeak that which I have ſeen with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> and ver. 42. <hi>I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of my ſelf, but he ſent me.</hi> For which reaſon he doth not diſcourſe of immortall life as a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, going about to prove it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and arguments; but onely aſſerts it as one that had Divine Authority, (for which he was to be believed,) and could himſelf make men eternally happy. This was the onely thing that could be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and needed proof, that he came from
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:204181:525"/>heaven to illuminate the world by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. And this he did not deſire they ſhould take upon his bare word, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly demonſtrated it: and told them, ver. 28. that after his death they ſhould ſtill ſee it made more evident that <hi>he did nothing of himſelf, but as the Father had taught him, he ſpake theſe things.</hi> For then, as you ſhall ſee in due place, God the Father declared all theſe words to be true by raiſing him from the dead.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things he ſaid ſo often, ſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo confidently, and with ſuch appeals to God, (who bare him witneſs, as you have heard, and never in the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted what he ſaid,) that we have great reaſon to believe he did not forge all this: but delivered the mind and will of God as ſincerely when he ſaid he would give men <hi>Eternall Life,</hi> as he did when he charged them to live <hi>ſoberly, righteouſly</hi> and <hi>godly</hi> in this preſent world. Certain it is, that He himſelf believed what he preached, and had no doubt, but a perfect aſſurance of it; as will appear if we paſs to the <hi>Second</hi> thing which we are briefly to conſider,</p>

                        <p>His own moſt holy Life, in the ſtricteſt obedience to God the Father. This <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbinell,</hi> in his diſcourſe upon xi. <hi>Iſa.</hi> which I have ſo often mentioned, makes one of the marks of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> the perfect temper of his deſires and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the direction of them according to the meaſures of the Divine Law. Which he thinks is the meaning of thoſe words, ver. 3. He ſhall be <hi>of quick underſtanding in the fear of the Lord.</hi> This was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who was ſo truly, ſo compleatly and conſtantly pious, that there never was any perſon ſo qualified to lay claim to this Dignity as he was. His Life was ſo free from all blame, ſuch a perfect abſtinence from all the pleaſures of this world, ſuch a contempt of all that which we think moſt worthy of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable labours; that it hath a ſtrong force in it to perſwade us, that he indeed ſought Eternall Glory, and was fully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured he ſhould be poſſeſſed of it for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and for all His.</p>
                        <p>Who but a man ſo perſwaded of his Doctrine would have lived in poverty,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:204181:526"/>when he might, no queſtion, by the multitude and devotion of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, have made himſelf incredibly rich? What ſhould incline him to remain all his days without an houſe ſo big as a fox or the ſmalleſt bird is owner of, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of that houſe which is eternall in the heavens? Could any thing move him to give away to the poor all that was given him, but a certain knowledge of great treaſures above? We cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what ſhould make him refuſe the dignity of a King, when the people intended to proclaim him; if it were not this undoubted perſwaſion, that he was the King of Heaven, and ſhould ſit down at the right hand of the Throne of God. Would any of thoſe that doubt this, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as he did, night and day, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Would any poor man cure mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of all diſeaſes, and take not a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his pains? Would any body live, if he could help it, and not know where he ſhould eat the next meal's meat? And who is he that can find in his heart to endure the hatred of the chiefeſt of the people, and to be in perpetuall danger of ſnares and treacherous deſigns for the taking away his life, without any hope to be a gainer by it? Is there any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:204181:527"/>that our Lord would have labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſuch ſort, as not to have leiſure ſo much as to eat, and after all that kind pains be content to be called De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver and Devill, and to run the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being ſtoned and killed; and yet have no aſſured expectation to reap ſome fruit hereafter from all his toil and trouble? Let him believe it that loves to ſting his fingers with nettles, or to roll his naked body in ſnow: we that have a more tender ſenſe of our own pleaſure muſt have leave to be of another mind. Let any man try to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelf to lead ſuch a life; and by his unwillingneſs he will eaſily be convinced, that our Lord, who could look for nothing in this world from what he did and ſuffered, would never have ſo chearfully, freely, and without any regret, followed ſuch a courſe, had he not known as ſurely that he ſhould be made glorious thereby hereafter, as he knew that he muſt be made miſerable by it here.</p>
                        <p>Ask his <hi>Poverty</hi> then, and that will bear witneſs that he laid up treaſures in the heavens. Ask his <hi>Humility,</hi> and that will tell you that he ſought for the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:204181:527"/>Glory of God onely. Inquire of his <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>Bounty,</hi> his wonderfull bounty to all men, and that will bear Record both that <hi>all fulneſs</hi> is in him, and that he will not envy any thing he hath to his followers. Let his <hi>Contentedneſs</hi> ſpeak, and that will aſſure you he was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſomething greater then all worldly goods; which he could tell better how to live without, then others to live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably withall. Examine his <hi>Labours</hi> and pains, his travells and journeys, trace his ſteps over ſea and land; and they will all confeſs that he ſought a better Country, which is an heavenly. Ask him what he meant by his <hi>Patience,</hi> his willing endurance of all reproaches, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, hatreds, perſecutions; and they will likewiſe conclude in the ſame teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that he had <hi>a joy ſet before him,</hi> which made him deſpiſe them all. In ſhort, conſult his <hi>Faſting</hi> forty days, his enduring ſo many temptations of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, ſlighting his offers, rejecting his counſels; and you can have no account of them but this, that he had indeed <hi>the meat that endures to everlaſting life;</hi> that he verily believed the voice from heaven, which ſaid he was the <hi>Son of God;</hi> and that he knew he had a greater Glory,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:204181:528"/>then all the Kingdoms of the world which the Devill offered him.</p>
                        <p>And after all this, I ſuppoſe there is no conſidering man but will think the unqueſtionable belief of ſuch a perſon as he was, to be of very great moment to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ours in this weighty buſineſs. It is ſafeſt for us, without all diſpute, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the judgment of one ſo well able to diſcern truth from falſhood, that he was <hi>of as quick underſtanding</hi> in all things elſe, as he was in the fear of the Lord. We have great reaſon to think that he was in the right; and was no more delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf, then he intended to delude others. There was not the leaſt flaw, as I ſhewed in the former Treatiſe, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his Underſtanding; nor could he be ſeduced into this belief by any earthly appetite or deſire: and therefore we ought to conclude, he was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied, by the moſt evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, that he ſhould live for ever, and be the Authour of Eternall Life to others: which, among other reaſons, ſhould very much ſatisfy us.</p>

                        <p>Who may farther conſider alſo the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of that famous perſon St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> That is, his whole Miniſtry, which is comprehended under the name of his <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> as <hi>Circumciſion</hi> ſometimes includes the whole Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> In this we ſhall find, if we examine it, a plain teſtimony to the great truth we are trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of, that ETERNALL LIFE is in <hi>Jeſus</hi> for all the faithfull. All that Nation who perſecuted our Saviour held <hi>John</hi> for a Prophet, and went to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of him. Inſomuch that the wiſeſt of them durſt not affirm that his Commiſſion was <hi>from men,</hi> (or that he taught and baptized the people from a private moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own,) but rather that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took this office by authority <hi>from heaven.</hi> Upon which account they were bound to receive his teſtimony concerning our Saviour, as unqueſtionable: which they themſelves clearly diſcerned to be a good conſequence; and therefore would not reaſon this matter out with our Saviour, but let it fall to the ground, when they themſelves had begun the diſpute.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="318" facs="tcp:204181:529"/>Now He teſtified as plainly that by him we ſhall have <hi>Eternall Life,</hi> as he did that he is the <hi>Son of God.</hi> For, (1.) as ſoon as ever he began to preach, he told them <hi>the Kingdome of heaven was at hand.</hi> iii. <hi>Matt.</hi> 2. Which language the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood well enough, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never askt what he meant: for ſo they had learnt, out of the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> to call the Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Whoſe throne was to be erected by an heavenly power, and not by any humane means; and under whoſe government they expected the greateſt bleſſings that heaven ever meant to beſtow upon them. Now that under this name the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> comprehends the Eternall Felicity which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould bring, is apparent from the expoſition which he makes of it, in the following part of the Chapter. Where he tells thoſe who were dubious, that he was not <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> but they might ſhortly expect him; and that when he came, he would <hi>gather the wheat into his garner,</hi> as well as <hi>burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</hi> iii. <hi>Matt.</hi> 12. This he ſaid when the chief of the <hi>Jews</hi> came to his <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> which was a teſtimony that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who preſently came after him, was to open the <hi>Kingdome of heaven,</hi>
                           <pb n="319" facs="tcp:204181:529"/>and gather all pious men thither, as wheat into a garner. Which though it denote firſt of all the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet muſt needs include in it the notion of a Church to be made exceeding glorious; becauſe the King of it hath his ſeat and throne no-where but in Heaven.</p>
                        <p>And then, (2.) after this the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> gave a more expreſs teſtimony of what they were to expect from <hi>Jeſus,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the World.</hi> i. <hi>Joh.</hi> 29. Which words muſt needs intend (as hath been ſaid already) that He is to reſtore us to the favour of God wherein our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſtood, to take away that which ſeparates between God and us, and to make us capable of Paradiſe again.</p>
                        <p>And ſtill more expreſly (3.) he ſays, iii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life: and he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee life.</hi> Unto which teſtimony our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals v. <hi>Joh.</hi> 33. after he had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing (ver. 25, 26, &amp;c.) of his power to give life to mankind. Indeed there was a witneſs, he ſhews, which <hi>in itſelf</hi> was far ſtronger then this; and that was
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:204181:530"/>
                           <hi>the Works which he did:</hi> but this was a better witneſs <hi>to them,</hi> (and therefore our Saviour uſes it,) who durſt not affirm <hi>John's Baptiſm</hi> was not from heaven; whereas they boldly ſaid the works of our Saviour were not from thence, but from the Devill. This is the meaning of thoſe words that follow ver. 34, 35, 36. after his appeal to <hi>John</hi>'s witneſs; <hi>But I receive not teſtimony from man: but theſe things I ſay that ye might be ſaved. He was a burning and ſhining light: and ye were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoyce in his light. But I have greater witneſs then that of John,</hi> &amp;c. That is, <q>Though I do not chiefly rely on any humane teſtimony, ſuch as <hi>John</hi>'s was, and indeed do not need it, (having one more immediately divine and heavenly:) yet for your ſakes, who have a good opinion of him, and own him for a Prophet, and whom I would willingly convince and ſave by any means, I inſtance in him ſo much, and re-mind you of what he ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me. That which makes me firſt of all ſpeak of his teſtimony, and ſo often refer you to it, is not, becauſe it is the firſt and chiefeſt in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, much leſs the onely teſtimony I have; but becauſe I think it will be moſt
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:204181:530"/>effectuall to doe you good: He being in himſelf a moſt excellent perſon, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning among you in great wiſedom and zeal; and alſo by you ſo eſteemed, and received among you (at leaſt for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) with a great deal of ſatisfaction.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And to this now adde (4.) another thing, which I took notice of in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treatiſe, and muſt here juſt call to remembrance; that our Saviour himſelf was baptized of him at <hi>Bethabara,</hi> a place that denoted him to be the perſon who ſhould lead men to their Reſt, the <hi>Joſhua</hi> that ſhould conduct them into the land of promiſe: and you will confeſs this WATER we are ſpeaking of to be the Water of life, which, if we drink of it, will revive and chear our fainting ſpirits. If we do but receive, I mean, the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> into our hearts; if we ſeriouſly conſider it together with the ſtrain of his Life; if we mark the office of St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the end of his Miniſtry, and the teſtimony which his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> gave to our Saviour; we ſhall find them all leading us into this comfortable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that He is the <hi>Prince of life,</hi> and that none can miſcarry who live as he taught, and tread in his ſteps; but have good
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:204181:531"/>hopes in this world, which ſhall not make them aſhamed in the world to come.</p>

<note n="*" place="margin">Aqua Genitalis.</note>;) who alſo bids us take notice, how that which they expreſſed in words, when they profeſſed to believe this great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Chriſtian Faith, was alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, as in an Image, by the very act of Baptiſm. In which <hi>the going into the water, and the coming out, was a ſign of their deſcending to the ſtate of the dead, and of their aſcending from thence to life again.</hi> There is no man that is baptized, but by the very rite and manner of it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to die, at leaſt, to ſin, and to riſe
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:204181:534"/>again to newneſs of life. This Death and Reſurrection (as the Apoſtle teaches vi. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, 4, 5.) is moſt lively repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there. But this is not all that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it: for even thoſe
<note n="*" place="margin">Arias Montanus.</note> who in that ſenſe were already mortified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by receiving the Holy Ghoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their baptiſm, (as <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his family,) proceeded notwithſtanding to receive that holy waſhing; and by their <hi>ſubmerſion</hi> took upon them the likeneſs of the dead, and by their <hi>emerſion</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as men riſen again from the dead. If there were no other death to be eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped but that in ſin, and no other reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to be expected but that to newneſs of life; why were they, who had attained theſe, baptized as dead men? and being already dead to ſin, why again ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned they the image of death, out of which they believed and profeſſed they ſhould come? This very action of theirs proves that they lookt for another reſurrection after death; which is the reſurrection of the body. And this profeſſion of theirs was ſo much the more weighty, as they were the more learned and inſtructed, being already taught by the Holy Ghoſt. By whoſe power they were already dead to ſin, and made alive to God; and by
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:204181:534"/>whoſe inſtruction they profeſſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that as there is another death, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the body, ſo they ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it by the mighty power of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> raiſing their very bodies from the dead.</p>

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:204181:537"/>arguments which prove him to be the <hi>Son of God.</hi> That alone indeed is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to juſtify all that he preached; particularly, that God by him will give <hi>Eternall Life</hi> to thoſe that obey him. If he be ſo nearly related to God, (as even his <hi>Bloudy</hi> Death, I ſhew'd in the former Treatiſe, proved him to be,) we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him when he ſays that, <hi>As the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf.</hi> But I ſhall wave this generall way of reaſoning, though undeniable; and offer ſome things more particular to every one's ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. It is apparent by the whole ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which it would be too long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, that to lay down his life was an act perfectly voluntary in our Saviour, who, if he had pleaſed, might have avoided it. He might have choſen whether he would have died or no: for <hi>no man</hi> (as he ſaid x. <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.) <hi>could take his life away, but he laid it down of himſelf;</hi> openly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</hi> He need not have faln into their cruel hands, it is plain, unleſs he had freely conſented to it. And when they were about to apprehend him,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:204181:538"/>many legions of Angels were ready for his reſcue, if he had pleaſed to lay his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon them. xxvi. <hi>Matt.</hi> 53. Nay, when he made the Souldiers feel his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſo that <hi>they went backward, and fell to the ground,</hi> (xviii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.) he could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all have eſcaped and gone his ways, as he had done at other times; when this reaſon alone is given why they did not apprehend him, as they attempted, <hi>becauſe his hour was not yet come:</hi> vii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 30. viii. 20. that is, He did not ſee it to be the fitteſt time for him to reſign up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to their power.</p>
                     <p>Now it cannot enter into man's deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate thoughts, that he would have ſo freely, without any conſtraint or reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, given up his life; eſpecially when by preſerving it he might have lived in great repute, eſteem and admiration of the people, yea, have been honoured for eſcaping out of the hands of his enemies; if he had not been ſure of ETERNALL LIFE and a greater glory in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, which he ſhould win by going ſo willingly out of this preſent world. <hi>He that ſaved others,</hi> could ſurely have <hi>ſaved himſelf,</hi> and ſpoiled their jeer; (xxvii. <hi>Matt.</hi> 42.) if his will had not been
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:204181:538"/>otherwiſe reſolved. He that raiſed <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> from the dead, could have more eaſily ſtruck all his oppoſers dead at his feet; if it had been his pleaſure. What ſhould make his will then thus bent upon death? What hindred the putting forth of his power for himſelf, which it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt he ſo often uſed for the benefit of others? What could move him ſo tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, like a Lamb, to give his throat to the bloudy knife, and to hang ſo meekly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an infamous croſs; if it were not the contemplation of an incomparable felicity which he hoped to obtain, by his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, and bearing witneſs to the Truth?</p>
                     <p>All men of ſenſe cannot chuſe but look upon this as an undoubted Argument, that he himſelf ſtedfaſtly believed, and had good aſſurance of, the truth of what he preached. For who is there that can find in his heart to die, and die in ſuch a manner, ſo painfully and with ſuch igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny, for that which he thinks in his conſcience is falſe, nay, does not know to be certain? It is next to an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that any man in his wits ſhould ſo far forget himſelf, as to be forward to throw away all he hath, againſt the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:204181:539"/>ſtrongeſt inclinations and perſwaſions of nature, which abhors death, and moſt of all a cruell and diſgracefull death, merely to juſtifie a lie; which humane Nature is aſhamed of, without the help of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make it odious. There have been ſundry examples of raſhneſs and fooliſh boldneſs; but none can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, nor eaſily imagined, of ſuch an one as this. For what can a man propoſe to himſelf, who lays his life at the ſtake, to make good that which he believes hath no truth in it? What can he hope to get by ſuch a mad reſolved obſtinacy? No man attempts any thing without an end; much leſs will he expoſe his life to the leaſt hazzard, without a cauſe of ſome moment. What can you ſee then in this caſe weighty enough to be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the balance againſt a man's life, which ſhould make him ſacrifice it freely, as our Saviour did? Riches, and all the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they can provide for us, could be of no conſideration; becauſe they will doe a man no ſervice when he is dead, and our Saviour had no poſterity to whom to leave them. Honour and Fame alſo ſeem to be of as little value; for what ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is it to be talkt of in the world, when we have left it, and hear nothing
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:204181:539"/>of what is done in it? Yet this is all that can be imagined to have any power in this buſineſs. One may poſſibly, you may fanſy, for to get a great Name in the world by being the Authour of a new Opinion or Sect, throw away his life; though he know that he doth but broach a lie. A ſtrange ſuppoſition this is, which a man in his right ſenſes, one would think, ſhould not be inclined to make. But ſince ſome have pretended it is poſſible, I ſhall briefly ſhew that it could have no hand in our Saviour's Sufferings. As will appear if we conſider, either the Circumſtances of his Death, or the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Doctrine, or the manner of his Life.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Circumſtances of his <hi>Death</hi> were ſuch, that if they be but a little examined, you will preſently find there is no place for this conceit. For (1.) it ſtands upon good record, that He himſelf knew of his death beforehand, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told it, with the manner of it: and yet was ſo far from endeavouring to avoid it, that he went of his own accord to the very place where he knew they would come to apprehend him. This is a plain declaration that he was no Impoſtour.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:204181:540"/>For though you may fanſy a man tickled with ſo much vain-glory, that he will not ſtick to embrace death, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not evade it, rather then unſay what he hath publiſhed, though he know it to be falſe: yet this is all that can with any colour be ſuppoſed. No ſuch perſon can be conceived willing to ſeek death, to offer himſelf to it, to go to the very place where he knows it waits for him, (when he may as well avoid it,) and deſignedly put himſelf into thoſe hands which it is apparent are reſolved to kill him. No; though fame be his deſign, yet the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his life, without all doubt, is his greater concernment: and if he can, he will enjoy both, his fame together with his life.</p>
                     <p>But if any body will be ſo extravagant as to fanſy, that He might intend to get fame, even by running himſelf into this danger; let him obſerve farther, (2.) what our Saviour met withall in his paſſage to his death, which would have ſtopt ſuch vain forwardneſs. For there was ſomething ſo dreadfull appeared to him in the way to his Paſſion, that when it approached <hi>he fell into an Agony.</hi> A great horrour ſeized on him, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:204181:540"/>how much Nature was againſt his proceeding. Whoſe ſtrong and violent inclinations would have prevailed againſt a fancy and vain humour; if he had not known that he was ingaged in a good Cauſe, and did not deceive the World. Such terrible apprehenſions as then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves, would have made him take the opportunity of the night, and conſult for his ſafety; if he had been a Deceiver, and not very well aſſured that this was the way to everlaſting Life.</p>
                     <p>And then, if you conſider again (3.) that he was not haſtily hurried to the gibbet, but had a long time to weigh what he was about to ſuffer; it will ſeem incredible that he ſhould not repent of his obſtinacy, if he had been conſcious to himſelf of any falſhood. For though in a ſudden heat of mad zeal a man may be ſuppoſed ſo fooliſh, as to maintain an untruth with the hazzard of his life: yet the ſight of long-continued torments ſet a great while before his eyes, would make him in all likelihood confeſs the truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="342" facs="tcp:204181:541"/>But (4.) that which quite overthrows this idle ſuppoſition is, that the kind of his death was ſuch as could procure him nothing leſs then glory and fame: there being nothing more infamous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful then to die like a vile ſlave upon a Croſs. This he could not but foreſee would expoſe him to the ſcorn of all the World; did not ſomething elſe gain him more credit then this could do diſgrace. And ſo it proved afterward; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Miracles he had wrought, his Crucifixion was the laughter of the Gentiles, and a ſtumbling-block to the <hi>Jews.</hi> From whence we may conclude that, if we will but allow him to be a man of common ſenſe, he would not have taken this way of all other to procure fame. No courſe he could have thought of to propagate his Doctrine would have been more mad then this; if it were not taken, as in all reaſon it ought to be, for a token of his ſincerity and truth in what he preached: which would be publiſhed, he knew, to his immortall honour and glory in all the world.</p>
                     <p>But dying ſuch a death as he did, there could be no hope, it muſt be farther
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:204181:541"/>conſidered, (5.) that his Doctrine ſhould be ſo much as publiſhed by his followers, much leſs received by others; unleſs he were both ſure himſelf that it was the truth, and that he could make the truth of it appear to them. And then what would have become of all the glory, for which it is ſuppoſed he might be tempted to part with his life? All that he could doe to ſecure his Diſciples, that he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched nothing but the truth, and to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them alſo to preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified, (which was a moſt odious and dangerous undertaking,) was to tell them that He would riſe again the third day, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear alive to them. Now it is as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt as the Sun, that, if he knew himſelf to be an Impoſtour, he could have no hope that God would raiſe him up again: and it is as manifeſt on the other ſide, that, if he did not riſe again, there was no hope that his Apoſtles would preach him, becauſe he had proved himſelf a liar: and if he was not preached by them, there could be no hope of glory and fame: and, conſequently, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have died in expectation of that, which, if he did but abuſe the World, he knew could not poſſibly attend upon his Name. For it is viſible, it muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:204181:542"/>have been buried in ſilence, or elſe remembred with reproach; He himſelf having blaſted it, by failing in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his word.</p>
                     <p>But I have ſaid enough of this, and therefore ſhall conſider onely one thing more, (6.) what it was that comforted our Saviour and ſupported his ſpirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs. Was it the hopes he had to be cried up by his followers, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified every-where, when he was dead and gone, for a man of an invincible ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? No; He comforted himſelf with the thoughts of his own integrity: He humbly addreſſed himſelf in prayer to God: He relieved himſelf with the thoughts that he was his Father; to whom therefore he commends his ſpirit, and breathed out his Soul in a pious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that He would receive it, and glorify him in the heavens. For a little before he ſuffered, he lift up his eyes thither, as St. <hi>John</hi> teſtifies, and ſaid, <hi>Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to doe: And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thy own ſelf, with the glory I had with thee
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:204181:542"/>before the World was.</hi> xvii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1, 4, 5. And when the moment of his departure was come, and he was juſt expiring on the Croſs, <hi>He cried out with a loud voice,</hi> that all might hear him, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit. And having thus ſaid, he gave up the ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that ſhall impute all this alſo to vain-glory, we may rather conclude takes a pride in cavilling and contradicting; and hath loſt all ſenſe of the Nature of man, which finds no inclinations in it to be thus audacious. For how can he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any hope in God, who at that very inſtant when he expreſſes it is committing the greateſt open affront unto him ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable? Our Bleſſed Saviour was ever a devout worſhipper of him, and in all his ways acknowledged him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince he did thus ſeriouſly betake himſelf to him in his ſoreſt diſtreſs, it is apparent he was perſwaded of his own ſincerity and truth: which God the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of all hearts knew; to whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he appeals, and was confident he ſhould live with him for ever, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give Eternall Life to others.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="346" facs="tcp:204181:543"/>III. But what need is there to inſiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer upon ſuch conſiderations as theſe, when his <hi>Doctrine</hi> (which is the <hi>Second</hi> thing I mentioned) is ſo holy and pure, ſo heavenly and divine, that the conſtant preacher of ſuch things could not be guilty of ſo great an impiety, as to call the God of heaven at laſt to bear witneſs to a known untruth? No; it condemns leſſer lies to ſo ſevere a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that to ſay, he was ſent of God with the words of Eternall life, nay, was <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> when he knew he was not, deſerved, according to his own ſentence, the heavieſt condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>To which if you add the <hi>manner of his Life,</hi> which was the <hi>laſt</hi> thing, it will compleat the Demonſtration. For it was ſo perfectly conformable to his Doctrine, that we cannot but think he believed it; and ſo could not die with a lie in his mouth. Particularly, it was ſo free from all covetous deſigns, and from hunting after the applauſe and praiſe of men; that it is incredible he ſhould ſeek that by death, which he had deſpiſed through the whole courſe of his life. If he was ſo
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:204181:543"/>thirſty of vain-glory, as to loſe his life for it; why did he not make it his buſineſs to win all he could of it, while he lived? Why did he not lay the foundation of his after-fame, by inſinuating himſelf, in the moſt diligent and men-pleaſing manner, into the favour of all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation? and conform himſelf ſo perfectly to their humour, that they might have preſently made him their King? Nay, why did he not accept the offer, when the people intended to advance him to the throne? This had been a more likely way to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and renown, if that was all his aim, then the lifting him up upon a Croſs. He might have hoped to build a laſting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the love of the Scribes and Elders of the people: whereas this infamous death, he could not but ſee, would make him ſo odious, that it would rob him of all mens good word, and quite fruſtrate the deſign of winning a reputation among men. This is a truth of which I preſume, by this time, the moſt ſuſpicious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing are convinced: who cannot but confeſs that the voluntary death of ſuch a perſon as this, and a death ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and ignominious, is a plain teſtimony of his ſincerity; and proves, beyond a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſonable contradiction, that he did
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:204181:544"/>not invent his Doctrine himſelf, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it to be of God; and did not ſeek to gain any thing by it but immortall life and glory in the world to come.</p>
                     <p n="4">VI. Now that we muſt needs be great gainers hereby as well as himſelf, will appear, if you conſider that he came into the world on purpoſe to doe mankind good, as the buſineſs of his whole life teſtifies. He <hi>went about doing good,</hi> and ſought all occaſions of obliging even the moſt ungratefull. He had compaſſion on every body he met withall, and never denied a cure to thoſe that begg'd it; though they were never ſo poor and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. He imployed his Diſciples alſo, who attended on him, in the ſame charitable works, of healing all manner of diſeaſes, and eaſting out unclean ſpirits. He bad them go, and ſpeak <hi>peace unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very houſe</hi> into which they entred. And as for themſelves, he profeſſed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt love imaginable to them, as they themſelves have recorded. He called them his <hi>Friends,</hi> and did not uſe them as <hi>Servants;</hi> nay, his <hi>Children,</hi> and at laſt his <hi>Brethren:</hi> which are all terms of much kindneſs and tenderneſs, which he ever expreſſed towards them. From whence
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:204181:544"/>I conclude that, unleſs he could have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them better by his death then by his longer life, he would not have ſo ſoon and ſo willingly gone to the Croſs, and there left theſe dear Friends, for whoſe ſake he had hitherto lived more then his own. If he had not died for their ſake too, and been certain he ſhould thereby ſhew more love to them, and doe them better ſervice then any other way; he would have been as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſtay ſtill with them, as they were to deſire it.</p>
                     <p>He ſaw how loth they were to part with him; and with what ſad countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and troubled ſpirits they received the news. He was incompaſſed with ſighs and groans when he did but mention it; for <hi>ſorrow</hi> (as he ſpeaks xvi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.) <hi>had filled their hearts.</hi> Would not this have moved a heart leſs tender then his, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this reſolution, when it was in his power to ſtay longer with them? How could he endure to ſee their tears flow ſo faſt, when he was able to dry them up with the ſpeaking but one word, that he would not leave them? If he had not been ſure that he was <hi>going,</hi> as he told them, <hi>to his Father,</hi> and that it was on
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:204181:545"/>purpoſe <hi>to prepare a place for them,</hi> which ought to have made them <hi>rejoyce</hi> rather then weep, becauſe <hi>he would come again, and receive them to himſelf, that where he was, there they might be alſo;</hi> (xiv. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 28.) without all doubt his great love would have yielded to their prayers, and commanded his power to prolong their happineſs in his company. He ſhould be able, he verily believed, to doe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wonders for them, and beſtow grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bleſſings upon them, if he did not hearken to their importunities; or elſe we cannot but think (if we meaſure him by our ſelves) he would have ſtill continued with theſe his dear Companions: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince none, as he profeſſed, could ſnatch him from their ſociety, but it was his own free choice to leave them.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. And he earneſtly deſired <hi>them</hi> to believe as much, and to look upon his BLOUD as the Seal of a <hi>New Covenant,</hi> which contained better promiſes then the former, between God and men. So he ſaid, juſt before his death, when he ſpoke of the Repreſentation of it, <hi>This is my BLO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D of the New Teſtament</hi> (or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>) <hi>which is ſhed for many for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</hi> xxvi. <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. And ſo
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:204181:545"/>the Apoſtles believed and ſpake of his BLOUD in the ſame terms; when by his reſurrection from the dead they ſaw that it was <hi>the BLO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> x. <hi>Heb.</hi> 29. and that he was moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent for this above all other things, as the expreſſion is xiii. <hi>Heb.</hi> 20. where the Apoſtle calls him the <hi>Shepherd of the ſheep,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>who was great in the bloud of the everlaſting Covenant.</hi> Now this is one Article every body knows, (one of the promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it,) that we ſhall as certainly have <hi>Eternall Life,</hi> as <hi>Iſrael</hi> in due time was brought to the poſſeſſion of the good Land God promiſed to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abraham,</hi> you reade xv. <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. had the word of God for it, that he would give his poſterity the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> into which he had brought him out of <hi>Chaldaea.</hi> And when he made ſo bold as to ask how he ſhould know that this was true, you find (ver. 9, 10, 11.) that God paſſed this promiſe into a Covenant, which was made by the bloud of ſundry beaſts: whoſe bodies being divided, and the halves laid one againſt another, <hi>a ſmoaking furnace</hi> appeared and <hi>a lamp of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:204181:546"/>fire,</hi> (repreſenting a Divine Preſence,) which paſſed between thoſe pieces, (ver. 17.) according to the cuſtom in thoſe days of making Covenants, by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties going between a beaſt ſo out aſunder. In like manner our Bleſſed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour promiſed more then once or twice the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> to all his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, moſt earneſtly intreating them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. And leſt they ſhould doubt of it, he proceeds at laſt of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to ingage himſelf to beſtow it, by entring into a ſolemn Covenant with them. Which was ratified, not by the bloud of beaſts, and the cutting their bodies in pieces; but by his own moſt <hi>precious bloud,</hi> and by ſuffering nails to be thruſt through his own fleſh: that he might confirm us in the belief of his <hi>promiſe of an eternall inheritance.</hi> ix. <hi>Heb.</hi> 15.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. And great reaſon there is we ſhould be confirmed by it in this belief. For what could he doe more to aſſure us he meant as he ſpake, then to ſeal it with his bloud? The Apoſtles juſtly took this to be <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>teſtimony</hi> or WITNESSE to the truth of that which he preached. So you
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:204181:546"/>reade 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 6. <hi>He gave himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for all,</hi>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>a teſtimony in due time.</hi> That is, <q>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the price of our Redemption, and, like the Paſchal Lamb, his bloud ſaves us from the deſtroyer, and aſſures us God will bring us to our Eternall Reſt; of which we cannot reaſonably doubt, ſince his giving himſelf thus to die for us is an evident teſtimony of God's great love to men, and of his <hi>will</hi> (which he ſpake of before ver. 4.) <hi>to ſave all men;</hi> by pardoning their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and bringing them to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life for <hi>Jeſus</hi> his ſake. His blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy death was an unqueſtionable <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> here calls it, of the truth of his promiſe; which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and ſealed in this ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by dying on the Croſs to verify it. And this he did at that very <hi>time,</hi> or <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> which was moſt <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> for ſuch a buſineſs: (juſt when the Prophets ſaid he ſhould doe it:) for in thoſe days (as we reade ii. <hi>Luk.</hi> 38.) <hi>they looked for redemption in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And he could not ſatisfie their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by any better means then this: which
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:204181:547"/>was <hi>illud Teſtimonium,</hi> as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> renders it, <hi>that Teſtimony,</hi> that remarkable <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> which none can juſtly queſtion. For it is taken by all for certain, that He doth not intend to deceive, <hi>qui morte ſuâ fidem facit,</hi> who ſeals what he ſaith with his bloud. This <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> I may adde, or WITNESS to the truth of what he preached, was moſt properly <hi>his own</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. There were ſundry others; but none, while he was on earth, ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly <hi>his</hi> as this: which was all he could doe to juſtify himſelf and his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. The <hi>Voice from heaven</hi> was a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as you have heard; but that was the teſtimony of the Father. His <hi>Doctrine</hi> was a Witneſs; but he ſaith of that, <hi>it is not mine, but his that ſent me.</hi> vii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. His <hi>Works</hi> or Miracles were a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as he ſays v. <hi>Joh.</hi> 36. but in the ſame place he adds, that they were <hi>the works which his Father gave him to finiſh;</hi> and xiv. 10. <hi>My Father doeth the Works.</hi> But as for his moſt precious BLOUD, it was that, and that alone, whereby <hi>He himſelf</hi> witneſſed the truth to us. <hi>For this cauſe he came into the world,</hi> as he tells <hi>Pilate,</hi> xviii. 37. and it was a free act of his own: for which reaſon he is ſaid to <hi>give himſelf</hi> for us, and to <hi>lay
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:204181:547"/>down</hi> his life; there being none, as I ſaid before, that had power, without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to take it away from him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may well be called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>That teſtimony,</hi> whereby <hi>He</hi> more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly witneſſed, that <hi>this was the will of him that ſent him, that every one who ſaw the Son, and believed on him, ſhould have everlaſting life.</hi> This he preached all his life, and he juſtified it to be true by his Death. When they would have had him revoke what he had ſaid, and deny that he was ſent upon this meſſage by God, he maintained it to the laſt drop of his bloud. Which was as much as could be done for the verifying of his Doctrine, and aſſuring the World that he ſincerely publiſhed the will of Heaven. For who can doe more then die for the truth which he aſſerts?</p>
                     <p>But he having thus atteſted by dying, that which God the Father had witneſſed before in his life-time by voices from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by ſigns and wonders, and ſuch like things; it pleaſed the ſame Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to give a more illuſtrious teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to Him, and to the truth of his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, then ever had been given either in his life or at his death: and that was by
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:204181:548"/>his Reſurrection from the dead. Which is commonly in the Holy Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to him, and made his work; (ii. <hi>Act.</hi> 24, 32. i. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 17, 20. &amp;c.) and evidently proved all that I have ſaid, and more too. For it ſhewed, that as he was not a deceiver of others, ſo he was not deceived himſelf. God hereby bad all the World believe what he had preached; and no longer make any doubt of that which he had teſtified, even by his own BLOUD, to be his heavenly Truth. But of this more in its proper place.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. Let us now conſider, that thoſe perſons whom our Saviour bad all men hear, becauſe they were ſent by him, as he was by the Father, have told us, (and the event proved it true,) that this BLOUD was ſhed <hi>to make peace;</hi> as you reade ii. <hi>Eph.</hi> 14, 15. That is, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles together, between whom there had been very long diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, ſo that of twain they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one new Man; and both ſerve him in the ſame Religion, and partake of the ſame privileges. What force there is in this to prove the right we have to <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Life</hi> you will ſoon ſee, when I have
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:204181:548"/>noted, that the intention of God to bring all the World to ſhare alike in his divine favour and love, which had been ſo much incloſed in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, was nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proclaimed by <hi>the rending of the veil of the Temple in twain,</hi> juſt when the veil of our Saviour's fleſh was torn, and he yielded up the ghoſt, xxvii. <hi>Matt.</hi> 50, 51. This was a plain indication, as <hi>Photius</hi>

                           <hi>Epiſt.</hi> cxxv.</note>, the famous Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> hath truly obſerved, a <hi>Symbol and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignification,</hi> to uſe his words, of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow and deſolation that was coming upon that Temple, and the Worſhip therein celebrated. How could it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe conſtrued, when that place wherein their moſt holy rites were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and their moſt venerable myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries kept from the eyes of the vulgar, was now laid open and expoſed <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as his words are, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon view and profanation?</p>
                     <p>This was a preface, as he calls it, to the utter ſubverſion and extinction of the reſt of their Ordinances, and their legall Worſhip. The conſequence of which was, as he likewiſe notes, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſervice of God according to the Law, which had been ſo long circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:204181:549"/>and ſhut up in one city and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, being to be aboliſhed; that worſhip which by the Paſſion of our Saviour was revealed, was to be eſtabliſhed, and ſpred to the uttermoſt parts of the Earth. And therefore the rending of the veil did as good as proclaim to all the world, and cry with a loud voice, ſaying, <hi>Come hither and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the inviſible things. Come</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>to the ſight of the divine Myſteries, from whence you have been ſo long excluded. Here is free leave for you all to enter, who have as much right as any to that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was inacceſſible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſince this moſt holy place was a type of Heaven, (God commanding <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to make all things according to the pattern in the Mount,) the ſhutting up of this from the people, and hiding the things contained in it, by a veil drawn before their eyes, was an acknowledgment that by the legall worſhip there was no entrance into the heavens; but the way was unpaſſable by thoſe that ſtuck onely to its rites and ceremonies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tearing of this veil by the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſignified as plainly, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle was removed; and preached to the world, as with the ſound of a trumpet,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:204181:549"/>that every one of us, by his BLOUD, may hope to come thither. For He that emptied himſelf for this very cauſe, as the ſame <hi>Photius</hi> writes, and took upon him our fleſh, and ſuffered all things for our ſake, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I mean, our God, hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a new paſſage into the kingdom of heaven, by his life-giving death. Which both diſſolved that old Religion, (as the very ſame thing you ſee foreſignified,) and introduced ſuch an one as will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bring us into the high and holy place, whether <hi>Jeſus</hi> our forerunner is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred for us.</p>
                     <p>And that this tearing of the veil in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was the effect of our Saviour's paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and precious BLOUD-ſhedding, is viſible from the relation which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall ſtory makes of this Prodigy. So I call it, becauſe you reade that it was not rent from the <hi>bottom</hi> to the <hi>top,</hi> as it would have been if the Earthquake (as ſome may be prone to ſuſpect) had been the cauſe of it; but <hi>from the top to the bottom.</hi> xxvii. <hi>Matt.</hi> 51. This evidently ſhews, it was an hand from above that made this breach: which following im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon our Saviour's giving up the ghoſt, was as ſenſible a token that it
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:204181:550"/>depended upon no other cauſe but that. The moſt impious are not able to deviſe any other reaſon of ſo ſtrange an accident. Which could have no naturall cauſe, (as an Earthquake may,) but proceeded from a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (as <hi>Photius</hi> his phraſe is) Divine vengeance, which gave the veil this ſtroke, and cut it quite in two; as an indeleble proof that it was the BLOUD of an innocent perſon which they now had ſhed. And indeed the Earthquake, there mentioned, was ſo far from being the cauſe of this rent, that it followed after it: that Power from on high which firſt ſlit the veil, next of all ſhaking the earth, and cleaving the rocks in ſunder.</p>
                     <p>To which I think it may be fit to adde, that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves tell us, the gates of the Temple uſed, after this, to open of their own accord forty years before its deſtruction

I know that thou ſhalt be deſtroyed in the end; for Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah propheſied of thee, Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy Cedars:</hi> xi. 1. Which new prodigy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by many of their Writers, together
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:204181:550"/>with the extinction of the Lamp that uſed to burn there, was a witneſs that God was going away from that place, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no longer to dwell in it; but would ſhew his Glory, which for many years had heretofore filled that houſe, to all the Earth.</p>
                     <p>Now then, if the Partition-wall was thus broken down through the BLOUD of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and all laid open and common, that we might enter upon the poſſeſſion of the Divine promiſes as well as others; it is certain, by the Witneſs of this BLOUD, that there is an Heavenly Inheritance for us, for Earthly there is none. Either we muſt obtain <hi>Eternall Life</hi> by him that died for us, or nothing at all. For there is no land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor any thing like it, given to us <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are now called to inherit the promiſes. We have no aſſurance of any worldly purchaces; no portion of money, vine-yards, olive-yards, or other goods of that nature, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to us, as there was to the ancient <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> But quite contrary, they that enjoyed the very <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> of the Divine Love, were told that every one who would live godly in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer perſecution; and take up their croſs,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:204181:551"/>and forſake all, if they would be his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. Accordingly we have examples of thoſe who ſold their lands, and when they had done, gave away the price of them: ſo far were they from thinking of any temporall rewards. Undoubtedly then, the Bleſſing which <hi>Jeſus</hi> purchaſed for us by his BLOUD, whereby he laid waſte all former incloſures, can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but great Poſſeſſions in another World; where we have the promiſe of an eternall Inheritance. This we ought to expect with the moſt aſſured confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: for we cannot make any doubt of it, unleſs we will look upon the BLOUD of <hi>Jeſus</hi> as more ineffectuall then the bloud of bulls and goats, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they held the Earthly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. And now let us once more look upon the BLOUD of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as the <hi>bloud of a Sacrifice;</hi> whereby all Covenants were anciently ſealed, and without which there could be no entrance, no not for the High-prieſt himſelf, into the Holy place where God dwelt. Thoſe inſpired perſons, whom, as I ſaid before, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour bids all men hear and reverence, frequently call his Death by this name. And common reaſon alſo leads us to have
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:204181:551"/>the ſame thoughts of it. For if it was not the BLOUD of the moſt precious and acceptable Sacrifice which He offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the Croſs, how could it put an end, as it hath done, to all the old Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which had ſtood ſo long by God's appointment; and make all the bloud that was afterward offered of no force at all for their preſervation from ruine? That it did ſo, is manifeſt by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of near ſixteen hundred years. And the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers themſelves confeſs, that the <hi>ſcarlet tongue,</hi> (as they call it) that is, the liſt of that colour and figure, which was hung between the Scape-goat's horns, or, as others will have it, at the door of the Temple, and always uſed to turn white, according to that in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.18. would never alter for forty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the deſtruction of the Temple, but ſtill continued red on the great day of Expiation. Which if it be true, (as we have their own faith for it,) was a ſhrewd token, that their moſt excellent Sacrifices were now able to doe them no ſervice; and that their Sins were of ſo deep a dye, having crucified the Prince of life, that nothing in the old Religion could purifie them. In vain did they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to hear that tongue ſpeaking peace
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:204181:552"/>to them, which was wont to publiſh good tidings; for it ſtill lookt as red as bloud, and told them there was no hope for them but in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who alone could make their crimſon ſins as white as wool.</p>
                     <p>By his bloudy Death they might ſue out a pardon of thoſe very crimes which they had committed againſt himſelf. For it being a Sacrifice, was for the remiſſion of Sins: or elſe the World had been in a worſe caſe then it was before, now that all other <hi>Bloud</hi> to cleanſe them was quite taken away. And there was no reaſon to doubt but God was perfectly well pleaſed and ſatisfied with this one Sacrifice of his; elſe he would not have raiſed him from the dead, nor admitted him into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, where, as He himſelf hath ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, he appears in the preſence of God, and by virtue of his Sacrifice makes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall interceſſion for us. Now this plainly infers (as hath been ſaid before) the hope of Eternall Life. For if there be <hi>remiſſion of ſins,</hi> then we are reſtored to the ſtate of innocence again. We are put into the ſtate and condition of the ſons of God; and there is nothing to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our being re-poſſeſſed of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> and the <hi>Tree of Life.</hi> To which we not
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:204181:552"/>being reſtored in this World, it remains that we be admitted to it and re-inſtated in it in another.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. Unto all which let the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the time be added when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſuffered: for that is not without its inſtruction in this buſineſs, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes ſomething to the confirmation of our faith. It was at the Feaſt of unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened Bread, (as they themſelves cannot deny,) a ſolemn time appointed by God to be obſerved at their departure out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> when they were ranſomed by a mighty hand, and purchaſed to be God's peculiar people, and began their journey towards the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which he had promiſed to their forefathers. At this Feaſt, it is well known, a Lamb, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate and pure, was ordered to be ſlain; whoſe bloud was that which ſaved them from the ſtrokes of the Angel of Death, who deſtroyed the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Now our Lord, the Lamb of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot and blemiſh, the Lamb of God that takes away the ſins of the world, (as St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> teſtified,) being ſlain at this very time, and hanging on the Croſs after the ſame faſhion wherein the Paſchall Lamb was wont to be killed; it
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:204181:553"/>was a Teſtimony clear enough, to thoſe that obſerved and laid things together, that his BLOUD was their ranſome from a greater ſlavery, and was ſhed to deliver them from eternall death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and, after they had travelled a while through the wilderneſs, as I may call it, of this world, and overcome there all difficulties and temptations, would procure their entrance into a better and more glorious Reſt then that wherein they were.</p>
                     <p>The Holy man who writes the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> proves unanſwerably, (chap. iv.) that the <hi>Reſt</hi> into which <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> brought the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was not all that good men expected, and which God intended to beſtow upon them. For if that great Captain had brought them to their finall Reſt, there would not have been mention made by the inſpired Pſalmiſt, many years after their ſettlement in <hi>Canaan,</hi> of <hi>another Reſt, which,</hi> as the words there are, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for the people of God.</hi> Now who can pretend to be the <hi>Captain of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> to conduct them thither, but onely our Bleſſed Saviour? whoſe Name is the ſame with that of the ancient <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi>
                        <pb n="367" facs="tcp:204181:553"/>or <hi>Jeſus;</hi> who was baptized at that very place where they entred into their Reſt in the promiſed Land; to whom the heavens there opened, and God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpake by an audible voice, and the Holy Ghoſt fell down in a viſible ſhape; who at laſt, after many promiſes and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances that he would bring them to the heavenly Country, was offered at that very time when their forefathers began their travells to their reſting-place; and hereby ſealed what he had promiſed by his bloud, as God the Father ſealed to it by divers acts of his, that He was a Lamb without ſpot, <hi>an offering and a ſacrifice to him of a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well might St. <hi>Paul</hi> call him <hi>our Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi> that <hi>is ſacrificed for us.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 7. For it is as viſible that he was ſlain for the ſalvation of mankind, as that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchall Lamb</hi> was ſlain for the preſervation of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and that as the deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel paſſed over thoſe houſes where he found the bloud of that Lamb upon the door-poſts, and ſpared the lives of the inhabitants; ſo all thoſe Souls that are ſprinkled with the bloud of <hi>Jeſus</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> believe on him) ſhall be delivered by him from periſhing, and preſerved to
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:204181:554"/>eternall Life. Which Salvation he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by offering himſelf freely as <hi>our Paſſeover;</hi> that is, for the like end (but as much excelling as Eternall life doth temporary) for which the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> was ſacrificed. And he made his ſacrifice the more remarkable, by offering it at that very time when the other was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and when they themſelves expected it. For ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay expreſly, which adds much weight to this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>on the ſame day of the month Niſan Iſrael ſhall be redeemed in the days of the Meſſiah,

                     </p>
                     <p>Now our Saviour made good his word, which he had often paſſed, that he would give them his very <hi>fleſh to eat;</hi> whereby they might feaſt with him, as they had done that day on the Paſchal Lamb. He gave them alſo his very <hi>bloud to drink;</hi> which was the price of their redemption, that which ſaved them from the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and overcame thoſe enemies which oppoſed their entrance into the Eternall Reſt. For <hi>his fleſh,</hi> (as he ſpeaks vi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 55.) being offered on the Croſs, <hi>was meat indeed, and his bloud drink indeed.</hi> That
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:204181:554"/>is, the moſt perfect food and excellent nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment; which hath a power to give (not a temporary, as the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> did, but) an Eternall life, to thoſe that partake of it by a lively faith in him. Some of the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves thought there was ſome greater Myſtery in the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> then the commemoration of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and ſay expreſly, that then God communicated his Divinity to men.

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:204181:555"/>
                        <q>
                           <hi>As the living Father</hi> (who, being the authour of life, can give it again to the dead,) <hi>hath ſent me, and I live by the Father:</hi> (ſhall riſe again, though I give my fleſh to be ſlain:) <hi>ſo he that eateth me</hi> (believeth on me though crucified) <hi>ſhall live by me;</hi> that is, be raiſed again to life by me, as I by the Father.

Which he will as certainly give to thoſe who do not refuſe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of this Sacrifice by believing in him, as the Father of life raiſed him from the dead to live for evermore.</q> Theſe words ſeemed <hi>hard</hi> to ſome of his Diſciples, ver. 60. who could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that there ſhould be ſuch virtue in his fleſh as to give life unto the world. But our Lord tells them, there was no cauſe of being offended at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; for if they would but ſtay a while, they ſhould be convinced that he did not aſcribe too much to it: ver. 62. <hi>What and if ye ſhall ſee the Son of man aſcend up where he was before?</hi> That is,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:204181:555"/>
                        <q>What will you ſay, if you behold me raiſed up from the dead, and aſcend into heaven, where I was before I took this fleſh? Will you not then confeſs that my <hi>Death</hi> (which is meant by his <hi>giving his fleſh</hi> to them) had an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great virtue in it, being ſo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God as to be thus highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded? Will it then ſeem incredible to you, that I ſhould obtain thereby a power to raiſe the dead, and to give eternall Life? This, ſure, will be a convincing argument that I have not ſaid too much of my BLOUD, nor promiſed greater things then it can doe for you. You will then, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, joyn your ſelves heartily to me, though now you are ready to fly off; and not think my Croſs ſuch a ſcandall, that it ſhould hinder you from being Chriſtians.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">X. And that will be one of our next works, in the following Chapter, to ſhew the power of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Reſurrection to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, that by his Death He will give life to the world.

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:204181:556"/>ſpices. But whether we can hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> now honoured him by theſe as the <hi>King of Iſrael,</hi> and the <hi>Prince of all the prophets,</hi> I cannot tell; becauſe the Evangeliſt (ver. 40.) ſeems to tell us, that the uſe they made of theſe ſpices was to imbalm his body, which <hi>they wound in linen cloaths, with the ſpices, as the manner of the Jews was to bury.</hi> Yet this we may ſafely conclude, that he would never have put himſelf to ſo great a charge, and laid out ſo much upon his dead body, if he had not ſeen ſomething which convinced him that this was <hi>that King</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who would give him a reward, for his love and open confeſſion of him, in his heavenly Kingdome. There was nothing to move him to ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, upon ſuch an hated perſon, but onely a perſwaſion that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was what he pretended; and an aſſured hope that by this fleſh, which now lay dead, the World ſhould be reſtored to life.</p>
                     <p>Yea, ſuch power there was in his Death to affect mens hearts, that not onely the Centurion confeſſed him to be <hi>a righteous man,</hi> but all the people who were come together to that ſight, beholding the things that accompanied his ſufferings,

With which the Holy Scripture agrees, when it names this as part of the Curſe of God upon <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hojakim,</hi> that none ſhould ſo much as ſigh at his buriall, nor make the uſuall lamentation, ſaying, <hi>Ah my Brother!

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:204181:557"/>ſupreme Court, the eſteem which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour wone to himſelf, even when he hung upon his Croſs, forced the people to break. Their affection to him was ſtronger then all Laws; and they could not contain themſelves when they ſaw what teſtimonies heaven gave of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and vertue; but did him pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick honour even at the very place of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. Though he ſuffered as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and vileſt offender in the world, yet the honeſt-hearted ſpectatours were not onely inwardly troubled in their breaſts at the ſight, but beat or knockt them alſo; and ſhewed thereby, that they were not afraid to own him as a moſt Excellent perſon, whoſe death they ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company with the bittereſt lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much may ſuffice concerning the Teſtimony of his BLOUD; which no man can hear ſpeak a word, but he muſt needs think, that which got him ſuch honour among the people in the midſt of his ſhame and the reproach of the Croſs, obtained a far greater glory for him with God in the heavens, who beſt knew how to value his obedience.</p>

                     <p>THough the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſo ſtrangely delivered out of their bondage, being ſaved by the Bloud of the Paſchal Lamb from the deſtroying Angel, and then freed from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who thought, it's like, that his bloud muſt next of all pay for the keeping them in <hi>Egypt:</hi> yet ſtill they queſtioned whether they ſhould come into the good Land or no, and were at a ſad plunge when they came to the Red Sea; imagining that they themſelves ſhould be there deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and become the next Sacrifice to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s cruelty. To confirm them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their belief of God's kind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions towards them, and perſwade them thoroughly that <hi>Moſes</hi> had not brought them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to kill them, but to ſave them, He gave him power to doe great wonders at that place, and in

                        <pb n="383" facs="tcp:204181:561"/>Whereby alſo, as you have heard, he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified to the World that he was no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, but came to them from God with the <hi>words of Eternall Life.</hi> Many things concurred to make this BLOUD a <hi>witneſs</hi> of his Truth, and of his power to fulfill his own promiſes. And yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, this was the very thing that offended many, and kept them from following him. They could not endure ſo much as to hear him ſpeak of giving them <hi>his fleſh to eat, and his bloud to drink;</hi> though he told them thereby he would <hi>give life to the World.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſtrengthen this Teſtimony of his BLOUD, and to convince them evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that he was the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the World, and gives life to it, there was another <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> which attended it, both before his BLOUD was ſhed, and likewiſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; which was the SPIRIT. That is, as I ſhewed in the former Treatiſe on this ſubject, <hi>the power he had to work won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and the miraculous power which rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the dead, and preſented him to God in the heavens.</hi> This was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient to prevent any offence they might take at <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified; and to ſettle in their hearts an unmovable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:204181:562"/>that he was their mighty Redeemer, who would bring them to the eternall Reſt which he had promiſed. For this is the laſt and greateſt argument which St. <hi>John</hi> here produces, ver. 6. <hi>He came no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Let us briefly therefore conſider, <hi>firſt,</hi> what his <hi>Miracles</hi> ſay to this; and then, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> what force there is in his <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> and <hi>Exaltation</hi> to prove it.</p>

                        <head>I.</head>
                        <p>And at our entrance upon the firſt of theſe, let us, before we go any farther,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:204181:562"/>weigh thoſe words of this Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> in his Goſpell, xx. 30, 31. where he tells us that he wrote the <hi>ſigns which Jeſus did</hi> (ſuppoſe after his Reſurrection) <hi>in the preſence of his diſciples,</hi> for this very purpoſe, <hi>that they might believe that he was the Chriſt, the Son of God; and that believing they might have LIFE through his Name.</hi> They were wrought by <hi>Him,</hi> and recorded by his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> for theſe two ends: that the World might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced He was the great Lord of all; and that they might, by faithfull ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, look for <hi>Eternall Life</hi> from his omnipotent love. It was the deſign of all his wonderfull works throughout his whole life, (to which the Apoſtle may have reſpect as well as to thoſe after his Reſurrection,) to perſwade men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he would make his followers ſo happy. For by theſe <hi>he manifeſted forth his glory,</hi> (as I obſerved before of the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Miracles</hi> in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> ii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.) and declared to the world, he could work as great a change upon our mortall bodies as he did then upon the <hi>Water;</hi> making them as much nobler then they are now, as the <hi>Water</hi> excelled it ſelf when it was become <hi>Wine.</hi> They were mighty inſtances of his Power; and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:204181:563"/>of his Goodneſs too: they made him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be the <hi>King of Iſrael,</hi> who was to <hi>deliver</hi> and bring <hi>Salvation</hi> to them; though much greater then they expected.</p>
                        <p>That our Lord did work Miracles, is a truth which they that crucified him can no more deny, then that he died. The wiſeſt of them could never find any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to affirm that the Goſpel-ſtory was but a fabulous Legend, which related Wonders that were never done. For if they had been able to ſay this, <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> the very beſt of them, would not have been put to ſuch diſtreſs, as to let fall theſe words, which we reade in his Treatiſe of <hi>Kings:
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Cap.</hi> xi.</note> Do not imagine that the King Meſſiah ſhall have any need to work wonders, or alter the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or reſtore the dead to life again, with ſuch like things, that fools talk of.</hi> Had he not known as well, that theſe things could not be denied which are related of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as he did that, their force to prove any thing being granted, they would be an unanſwerable teſtimony to him, he would never have thus ſlighted (as he doth in many other Books) things of this nature; which brought the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt reputation to <hi>Moſes</hi> among their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:204181:563"/>and were the cauſe why they believed on him, though he attempted no ſuch wonder as the raiſing dead men to life again. Our Saviour, he was not ignorant, very often appealed to his <hi>works,</hi> as the teſtimony of God to him; and thought it ſufficient to tell <hi>John</hi>'s diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, when they came to inquire who he was, that <hi>he opened blind mens eyes, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed lepers, and raiſed up the dead;</hi> by which they might anſwer their own que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. And therefore ſomething was to be ſaid by this <hi>Jew</hi> to diſparage theſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he ſaw the credit of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in great part relied. Now had it not been the readieſt way to deny that there were ſuch Miracles wrought? Nothing but the notoriouſneſs of the facts made him wave that courſe; which drove him upon this wretched ſhift, of denying ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly that Miracles are credible witneſſes to him that works them. By this means he thought to rob our Saviour of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they brought him; and was ſo blind as not to ſee that, at the ſame time, he took away from his own Maſter the greateſt ſupport he had of his Authority. And therefore herein he is deſerted by his own Country-men, particularly by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbinel;</hi> who, as I obſerved before,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:204181:564"/>makes the power of working Miracles one of the principall gifts of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> In which our Lord, it is apparent to his very enemies, was ſo eminent, that one cannot imagine why he did not believe on him; unleſs, with the ſpitefull <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi> he imputed all his Works to the Devill. Which blaſphemy, I have ſhewn in the former Book, is ſo manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by his holy Doctrine and Life, that they muſt be no leſs fooliſh then malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous who regard it. We ask no more, but to allow ſuch things were done as the Goſpell reports: (which they dare not deny us:) and then their great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty what to ſay againſt them, ſhews how forcible they are to convince all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different men that he came from God; whoſe finger they were, pointing them to him as the Perſon whom they ſhould hear and obey.</p>
                        <p>And that they were a plain demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his power to give <hi>Eternall Life</hi> to all his followers, will appear from theſe following conſiderations.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. If they confirmed all his Doctrine to be the Will of God, then we ought to look upon this as firmly eſtabliſht by
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:204181:564"/>them; for it was a known part of his Doctrine, that God ſent him to proclaim his purpoſe of giving everlaſting life by him, to all thoſe who ſhould believe on him. vi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 38, 39, 40. iii. 16. There is nothing in this aſſertion needs proof, but that they confirmed his Doctrine, (this being, it is apparent to all, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant part of it;) in which the Blind man thought he could preſently ſatisfy any reaſonable perſon, when he ſaid, <hi>If this man were not of God, he could doe nothing.</hi> ix. <hi>Joh.</hi> 33. That is, no ſuch Miracle as that was, of opening the eyes of one born blind; a thing the world had never heard of, ſince it was firſt created, till that time. He preached nothing but pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and holineſs; He lived as he preached: both his Sermons and his Converſation were above all that ever had been for Sanctity: And his Works being ſo alſo, much beyond the moſt famed Prodigies the world had ever boaſted of; it was an unanſwerable argument that God was in him; who was never known to have let ſuch things be done before, in the compaſs of ſo many Ages; and therefore would not let them now doe their firſt Service to the countenancing of a lie. And therefore to theſe our Lord often
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:204181:565"/>refers them, as there was reaſon, for a proof of his Divine Authority. For if a falſe prophet could doe ſuch wonders, how ſhould there be any poſſibility of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knowing a true? Reade x. <hi>Joh.</hi> 37, 38. xiv. 10. xv. 24.</p>
                        <p>That which is moſt proper for me to note is, that in that xiv. of St. <hi>John,</hi> when he bids them look upon his <hi>Works,</hi> as the beſt glaſs (that then was) wherein to ſee his Divinity, he was diſcourſing on this very ſubject, that <hi>He was the Life,</hi> ver. 6. and that He was <hi>going to the Father</hi> to live with him, and to <hi>prepare a place for them,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 2, 3. Of this he could not give them a better evidence then the <hi>Wonders</hi> he had wrought, untill his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi> After which indeed (he ſaith ver. 12.) they ſhould <hi>doe greater works then theſe;</hi> which would more plainly tell them that he <hi>was with the Father.</hi> It will not be unprofitable if I open the whole diſcourſe, from verſ. 2. where he tells them, with a ſolemn profeſſion he would not abuſe them, that <hi>in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe are many Manſions;</hi> and that he was <hi>going</hi> away indeed from them, but it was in order <hi>to prepare a place for them.</hi> He departed, he would have them
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:204181:565"/>believe, not merely to go to reſt himſelf after all his labours; but to take up lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, as one may ſay, for them in that bleſſed Reſt prepared for the people of God. Now the conſequence of this he tells them in the next words, ver. 3. <hi>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto my ſelf; that where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi> He aſſures them, that is, he would not loſe the pains he had taken to procure ſuch a happineſs for them; but ſee them ſafe there, where they ſhould have their ſhare with him in that very bliſs which he was about to receive. <hi>And where I go, ye know, and the way ye know:</hi> ver. 4. As if he ſhould have ſaid, You underſtand well enough what I mean: (for I have often ſpoke of theſe things:) I go to Heaven, to live with God, and to give life to thoſe that believe on me; which that you may not miſs of, I have ſhewn you both by my doctrine and my example the way that leads to it. Alas! replies one of his Apoſtles, who ſeems to be the ſloweſt of all other to apprehend his meaning, or give credit to him, <hi>Lord, we know not whither thou goeſt; and how can we find the way?</hi> ver. 5. No? ſaith our Saviour to him again, that is ſtrange. I my ſelf
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:204181:566"/>
                           <hi>am the Way,</hi> from whom you might have learnt how to arrive at this happineſs. And that this is the true way, which I have deſcribed, you need not doubt; for <hi>I am the Truth;</hi> that is, the teacher of truth, who have demonſtrated ſeverall ways, that what I declare is the very mind and will of God. And the ſame arguments which prove me to be the Truth, evidently ſhew alſo that <hi>I am the Life;</hi> who will conduct you to that bliſs unto which I am now going. <hi>And no man cometh to the Father,</hi> (and that Eternall life which is with him,) <hi>but by me;</hi> that is, by believing my words, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſteps: ver. 6. And therefore if you had minded me and my words, (as it follows ver. 7. <hi>If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father</hi> alſo,) you would have known it is my Father's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to give you Eternall life: And from henceforth ſure you will not doubt of it, now that I have revealed it ſo plainly, that I may ſay <hi>you know him, and have ſeen him.</hi> Upon this Anſwer of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, another of his Apoſtles wiſht they might but ſee the Father, and that would be <hi>ſufficient:</hi> ver. 8. He deſired, that is, there might be ſome ſuch Divine appearance to them, as there was to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
                           <pb n="393" facs="tcp:204181:566"/>and others of the Patriarchs in old time, and they would trouble him with no farther queſtions about this matter. How? ſaith our Saviour, <hi>have I been ſo long with you, and yet haſt thou not known me, Philip?</hi> that is, underſtood what kind of perſon I am? Doſt thou not ſee that I am the onely-begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, full of grace and truth? the expreſs image of his perſon, and the brightneſs of his glory? Was there ever ſuch an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God in the world, as thou ſeeſt in me? All the Fathers enjoyed was but a little glimpſe of the Divine glory, in compariſon with that which now ſhines upon you in my face. And therefore why doſt thou ask to ſee the Father, as if there was nothing of him in me? I tell thee, <hi>He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father.</hi> And ſo it follows ver. 10. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I ſpeak unto you I ſpeak not of my ſelf; but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.</hi> The properties of God are known by the works that he doeth; and there are ſuch wonderfull evidences of a Divine power as well as wiſedom in me, that all the Viſions the Prophets had, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the Miracles they did,

                           <hi>The Son is a brief and eaſie demonſtration of the Nature of the Father:</hi> who appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in him, and ſpake by him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared both how good and how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full he is, not onely by all that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaid, but by the Works that he did. Which were moſt manifeſt tokens that God was in him; and that his words were the words of God; and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that in him we have life; and that he went to heaven, as he ſaid, to prepare a place for us; and that he will come again, and receive us unto himſelf, if we walk in that way which he hath chalked out to us by his moſt holy Life.</p>

                           <pb n="395" facs="tcp:204181:567"/>This our Saviour aſſerts alſo in other places, where he alledges his <hi>Works</hi> as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of this very Doctrine. I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely two more, and ſo diſmiſs this Argument. In the v. <hi>Joh.</hi> 28, 29. he tells the obſtinate <hi>Jews,</hi> it was no ſuch marvell that a dead man ſhould be raiſed up by him; if they conſidered, which was far more wonderfull, that he was the Perſon who would one day call all mankind out of their graves, and give unto the good <hi>Everlaſting Life.</hi> For proof of which he puts them in mind preſently after of his <hi>miraculous Works,</hi> (ver. 36.) which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified God had ſent him, and would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify all that he ſaid. And thereupon he exhorts them to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures, for in them you think ye have eternall Life; and they are they which teſtify of me. But you will not come to me, that you may have life:</hi> ver. 39, 40. Which was as much as to ſay, You all look for ETERNALL LIFE, and you hope in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to find it: I wiſh you would be more diligent in peruſing them; for they ſhew plainly that I am He who muſt bring you to it. But this is the miſery of your condition, that neither my <hi>Works,</hi> (ſpoken of before) nor the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:204181:568"/>teſtimony of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> (which he firſt alledged ver. 32, &amp;c.) will perſwade you to believe on me; without which I cannot beſtow Life upon you.</p>
                        <p>The ſame he tells them x. <hi>Joh.</hi> 25. Where he ſaith, <hi>The works that I doe in my Father's name, they bear witneſs of me.</hi> They made it ſo apparent, that is, he ought with all readineſs to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that he could not judge, as you reade in the next verſe, their infidelity came from any thing but improbity. Now what it was his works witneſſed, he tells us ver. 27, 28, 29, 30. <hi>viz.</hi> that to his ſheep, who were obedient to him, he would give <hi>Eternall Life:</hi> of which they ſhould have ſuch a ſure poſſeſſion, that they ſhould never loſe it; becauſe none ſhould be able to wreſt them from him, with whom God himſelf had intruſted them; who would maintain and defend them, and their right to it, without any poſſibility of plucking them out of his hands. His Father, he means, had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to beſtow this Life on all his followers, who was able to make good his own purpoſe and promiſes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Works he did made it appear that He and the Father were one; ſo He
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:204181:568"/>would certainly make good the Doctrine which he preached, (and thus by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles confirmed,) that they ſhould <hi>have Eternall Life, and never periſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. This we may reaſonably think his Miracles declared, if we conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quality of every one of them; which, in generall, was the doing of ſome good or other to mankind. What did this ſpeak, but that He was come to be the Authour of the greateſt happineſs to them? They could not well pick leſs ſenſe out of his Works then this, when they ſaw him beſtow ſuch benefits, that He was of GOD, <hi>who is Good, and doeth good,</hi> and would never ceaſe his loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs to the World. For the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and the conſtancy of his Miraculous acts of bounty, in ſo many places, to all ſorts of men, throughout his whole life, declared the largeneſs, the univerſality, and unchangeable perpetuity of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which would withhold no good thing from upright perſons. And therefore in his Anſwer to the Queſtion which <hi>John</hi>'s diſciples propoſed, you find his opening the eyes of the blind, cleanſing the lepers, making the lame to walk, and ſuch like miraculous works, in conjunction with
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:204181:569"/>his <hi>preaching the Goſpell to the pooreſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> which was nothing elſe but this glad tidings of <hi>Eternall Life.</hi> xi. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. This he publiſhed ſo plainly as none before him had done; and that they might be diſpoſed to believe him to be the perſon in whom all nations ſhould be bleſſed, He did ſuch Miracles as none before him had done: which were all bleſſings, the greateſt favours and kindneſſes to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; but no hurt to any one man in the world. This was a greater Argument to receive him as the Authour of <hi>Eternall Life,</hi> which he promiſed, then the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in <hi>Egypt</hi> were to perſwade the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould redeem them, and bring them to temporall felicity: inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the conſtant doing innumerable benefits to men renders one far more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, then the killing and deſtroying them.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. But then, if you more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly conſider, that a great many of his Miracles were the reſtoring men to their primitive ſtate of integrity and ſoundneſs of body, by removing the ſickneſſes and diſeaſes which Sin had brought upon them it was a notable ſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        <p n="4">VI. The like another ſort of Miracles ſeems to ſuggeſt to us; which was his feeding ſo many thouſands at a time with a ſmall quantity of proviſions. Of which you reade (as in other places, ſo) in vi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5, 6, &amp;c. where you find, that with <hi>five barley loaves and two ſmall fiſhes</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained about five thouſand people ſo plentifully, that every one of them had as much as he deſired: and when they had done, there were twelve baskets of frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which remained over and above to them that had eaten. This Miracle made the multitude conclude that certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly He was <hi>the Prophet</hi> who ſhould come into the world: and therefore they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, whether he would or no, to come and make him <hi>their King:</hi> ver. 14, 15. And when he avoided it by croſſing the ſea privately, (ver. 16, 17, &amp;c.) they alſo
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:204181:570"/>took ſhipping to follow after him, and never reſted till they had found him: ver. 24, 25. Whereupon our Lord takes occaſion to tell them, how ſorry he was to ſee them ſo induſtriouſly purſue the food of their bodies, and not mind the food of their Souls, to which his late Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle led them: and in plain terms tell them, that Spirituall food was himſelf; who was the <hi>Bread of life</hi> they ſhould hunger after, more then for the loaves wherewith they had been filled: and that if they did eat of him, they ſhould have <hi>everlaſting life, and he would raiſe them up at the laſt day,</hi> ver. 26, 27. and 35, &amp;c. This they might eaſily have believed, if they had conſidered the Miracle of the loaves; which was a token from God that he could ſupport them eternally. For why ſhould not he be able to give life, who ſo ſtrangely preſerved it? and out of a little duſt make a body, as he had out of a few crums made ſo many loaves? If their deſires had been fixed upon this <hi>Eternall Life</hi> which he preached, as much as upon the preſent, they would as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have taken this Miracle for <hi>the Seal</hi> whereby God noted him to be the giver of it, as they took it to be a mark that he could thus fill their bellies every day,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:204181:570"/>and ſave them the labour of ſeeking food; after the manner that <hi>Moſes</hi> fed their Fathers with Manna in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. And next to this, if you conſider how he diſpoſſeſſed Devils, which was a Wonder as frequent as any, if told the world plainly that He was come to <hi>deſtroy the works of the Devil,</hi> to overthrow his kingdom, and deveſt him of his power, unleſs they would ſtill uphold him in it. By Sin he held his Throne; this gave him all the power he had over men, and made them his vaſſals and ſlaves. Who being ſo often reſcued out of his hands, and he ſo openly foiled; it was a ſign that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was come to take away the ſins of the world, and thereby diſarm him of the power of death, and reſtore men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to that everlaſting Life, out of which the Devil had before thrown mankind, as our Saviour now threw him out of them.

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:204181:574"/>ſhould give an example of it in his own.

He was wrapt in Cerecloaths, laid in a grave, and given up by all his Friends for a loſt man. But that after all this he was as really alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as he had been before, is teſtified by divers ſufficient Witneſſes; and among the reſt by one of his principall Enemies, who was throughly convinced of it. The Apoſtles ſaw him very often; they ſpake with him; they felt and handled him; one of them put his finger into the very print of the nails, and thruſt his hand into his wounded ſide. They eat and drank with him; they received Commiſſions from him: and after he had ſhewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alive to them by many infallible
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:204181:575"/>proofs, being ſeen of them forty days, he aſcended up to heaven in their ſight; and from thence, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, they received the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>i. e.</hi> in his Name did all ſorts of Miracles, raiſing even dead men to life again. And after all he appeared from heaven to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (a man that ſet himſelf vehemently againſt him, and breathed nothing but threatnings and ſlaughters againſt his Diſciples,) whom he turned quite to be on his ſide; perſwading him ſo fully that he was indeed riſen from the dead, that he became, as you have heard, a moſt zealous preacher of it with the continuall hazzard of his life. This is a more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Hiſtory then any other: (as it were eaſie to ſhew, if it were my preſent buſineſs:) and we may better doubt of all Records, then of thoſe wherein the memory of theſe things is preſerved. They were holy, devout and ſelf-denying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who report theſe things upon their own knowledge. And they are reported not by one or two, but by many of them; who met with nothing in the world to tempt them to tell a lie, but with a great many things to deterr them from publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſo odious a Truth. And therefore if we will not doubt of every thing we
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:204181:575"/>do not ſee, we cannot refuſe to believe that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did indeed riſe again after he was dead and buried, and aſcended into heaven. Which being ſuppoſed, (for I ſhall ſay no more of it here,) there is no man can have the face to deny <hi>the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body,</hi> and <hi>Life everlaſting,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord hath promiſed us. There can be no truer reaſoning then that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> iv. 14. <hi>If we believe that Jeſus died and roſe again, even ſo them alſo that ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">I. For thus much is evident at firſt ſight, and is included in the thing it ſelf, that this work of the SPIRIT proves a poſſibility of the Reſurrection of the dead, and ſhews that we mortal creatures, who live on the earth, may live in the heavens. So the ſame Apoſtle argues elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where againſt thoſe who denied this Truth. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 12. <hi>If Chriſt be preached</hi> (upon ſuch credible teſtimonies as he mentions in the foregoing verſes) <hi>that he roſe from the dead, how ſay ſome among you that there is no reſurrection of the dead?</hi> It is the groſſeſt abſurdity, that is, to ſay there can be no ſuch thing as the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a dead body to life; when it is
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:204181:576"/>ſo evidently verified in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which ſhews it is ſo far from being impoſſible or incredible, that it is a thing which hath been done already; as is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well atteſted by Witneſſes that cannot with any equity be rejected. And by the ſame reaſon he proves we ought not to deſpair of ſeeing our bodies made glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and incorruptible. For if He be not in his grave, (as none could ſhew him there after the third day,) but is made glorious; why may not we partake of the ſame favour, by that power which raiſed <hi>Chriſt</hi> from the dead, and ſet him at God's right hand? There is no reaſon to doubt of it; but the greateſt reaſon to hope and be confident, that <hi>He who raiſed up the Lord Jeſus</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in the next Epiſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 14.) <hi>will raiſe up us alſo by Jeſus, and ſet us in his preſence</hi> in the heavens.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. For by his Reſurrection the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT proved the truth of all that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Witneſſes, <hi>the Water, the Bloud,</hi> and his Miraculous <hi>Works</hi> too, teſtified. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly it demonſtrated the truth of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> by which, as you have ſeen, <hi>life and immortality was brought to light.</hi> If this had not been true, that we ſhall
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:204181:576"/>live for ever by him, <hi>Jeſus</hi> would have periſhed, and never have come to life again, to deceive the World the ſecond time. But ſeeing God did not leave his Soul in hell, nor ſuffer his <hi>Holy (i. e.</hi> his anointed) <hi>one</hi> to ſee corruption; it is an uncontroulable argument that thoſe who believe on him ſhall not periſh neither, but be made alive as he is. Becauſe He that ſaid he would riſe again the <hi>third</hi> day, ſaid likewiſe with the ſame aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that at the <hi>laſt</hi> day he will raiſe up us alſo, and beſtow upon us everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Life. When God (who alone could doe it) verified the one, and according to his word raiſed up <hi>Jeſus</hi> the third day; He bid us be aſſured of the other, that this <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath Life in himſelf, and will by his power raiſe up us, according to his promiſe, unto a never-dying life.</p>
                        <p>This is the Character He had given of himſelf, <hi>I am the Reſurrection and the Life;</hi> that is, the Authour, the Cauſe of both: <hi>He that believeth on me ſhall have everlaſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day;</hi> nothing of him ſhall periſh, neither his Soul nor his body; for even <hi>they that are in their graves ſhall hear his voice,</hi> and ſhall riſe again to liſe. This
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:204181:577"/>he often preached, and proved many ways: but after all he ſealed it with his bloud, and bad them expect a little, and they ſhould ſee it ſealed by his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the dead. Which inſuing at the time appointed, was a perfect demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration that he ſaid true, when he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that He is the <hi>Reſurrection and the Life;</hi> by whom we ſhall receive this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable benefit of riſing again after death, to live for ever with him. Of this as well as the former Conſideration I may poſſibly ſay ſo much elſewhere, that I ſhall ſpare any farther pains about them now.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Let us rather remember how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall perſons roſe from the dead at that very time when he left his grave: (xxvii. <hi>Matt.</hi> 52, 53.) which were notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his power to give life; and put us in hope that we ſhall all riſe again as they did. There is no cauſe but his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to be aſſigned of this Miracle, which fell out the ſame time that he was miſſing in his grave; as the opening of their tombs, at that very moment when he died. Never was any ſuch thing heard of before or ſince; and therefore it was intended to demonſtrate the mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:204181:577"/>of his Reſurrection: when <hi>many bodies of Saints which ſlept aroſe, and came out of their graves, and went into Jeruſalem, and appeared unto many.</hi> Whoſe teſtimony none have had the confidence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict by endeavouring to diſprove it; but the <hi>Jews</hi> rather by ſome conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theirs confirm us in the belief of it. For it is a common opinion now among their <hi>Doctours,</hi> that <hi>the Kingdom of the Meſſiah ſhall begin with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead.</hi> Bury me, ſaid R. <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> with ſhoes on my feet, and my ſtaff in my hand, and lay me on one ſide; that when <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes, I may be ready. But of this conceit we can find no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps in the Old Scriptures; which makes it probable that they have borrowed this, as they have done many other things, from the Holy Goſpell, in which it is recorded, that he began his entrance upon his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with the Reſurrection of ſome pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, as an earneſt of the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the reſt to Eternall Life. And thus it is likely they have learnt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the bodies of the juſt after they are raiſed; concerning which ſome of them ſpeak ſo ſublimely, above the dull and groſs conceptions of the reſt of their Nation, that one can ſcarce look upon
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:204181:578"/>it otherwiſe then as Chriſtian language. <hi>When the Soul is in the ſtate of glory,</hi>

<pb n="417" facs="tcp:204181:578"/>of the Father. Concerning which things if the Apoſtles had written falſe, and there had not been <hi>many</hi> able to <hi>bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> of the riſing of theſe <hi>holy perſons,</hi> and coming into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as well as of the riſing of <hi>Lazarus;</hi> there would have been pens enough in thoſe days imployed to confute them, and proclaim the forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And theſe <hi>Jews</hi> would have been as carefull preſervers of ſuch confutations, as of any their moſt beloved Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which can never doe them ſo much ſervice, as thoſe volumes would have done.</p>
                        <p n="4">VI. Nor is there the leaſt ſhadow of reaſon to queſtion the Teſtimony of thoſe who ſaw him <hi>aſcend into heaven,</hi> and, as a token of his being inthroned there, received from him, ten days after, the gift of the Holy Ghoſt. Which complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the demonſtration of his power and purpoſe to give <hi>Eternall Life</hi> to all his followers. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. His very Aſcenſion into heaven (as it breeds in us a belief of a glorious ſtate in the other World, ſo it) evidently ſhews that it is poſſible ſuch as we may be tranſlated thither: And though our
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:204181:579"/>Bodies now be but lumps of living clay, yet they may one day be ſnatched, as he was, from this dull globe, to ſhine among the Stars. And the Angels alſo appearing both at his reſurrection and aſcenſion, and waiting upon him unto heaven, ſhew that its gates are no longer barred againſt us, but ſet open again to give us a free admiſſion into it. For they who were ſet to watch the way to Paradiſe, and guard it ſo that none ſhould enter, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily lent their aſſiſtence to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Him thither, after they had brought the joyfull news of his being riſen from the dead.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But this is the leaſt comfort we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from thence; for his glorification at God's right hand, when he came thither, advances our hope to a greater height; and ſhews that it is not onely poſſible, but certain, we ſhall be taken up above to be with him. His Kingdom, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent now, (by his ſending the Holy Ghoſt,) is ſupereminent over all; and nothing can be out of the reach of his power. For it is a power over all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>in heaven and earth and under the earth,</hi> who doe obeiſance to him, and cannot reſiſt him. ii. <hi>Phil.</hi> 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:204181:579"/>
                           <hi>ult.</hi> And a power to doe all things: for <hi>God hath put all things under his feet.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 27. A power of conferring all digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and honours; iii. <hi>Phil.</hi> 21. and of removing all impediments to our prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, He having the <hi>keys of hell and death.</hi> i. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. In ſhort, a perfect pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to doe all things to make us glorious. <hi>For in that he put all in ſubjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him,</hi> as the Apoſtle argues ii. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. And though he hath not yet exerciſed his whole unlimited power, as it there follows, yet we are ſure he hath it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>we ſee</hi> (by manifeſt arguments) <hi>Jeſus crowned with glory and honour for the ſuffering of death.</hi> By which the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God thought fit to <hi>conſecrate this Captain of Salvation;</hi> who he deſigned ſhould <hi>bring many Sons unto glory</hi> together with himſelf.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Which He will not fail to doe, we may be ſure, being thus <hi>perfected</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly furniſhed for the very purpoſe: becauſe this Royall power wherewith he is inveſted is a kind of Truſt; and he hath received it (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly ſuppoſes 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 24, 25, &amp;c. where he ſpeaks of his Kingdom) not onely for himſelf, but
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:204181:580"/>for the good of all thoſe whom he rules and governs. For the Apoſtle concludes that he, having a Kingdom which muſt at laſt be reſigned into the hands of God the Father, will firſt put down all rule, all authority and power, and leave no enemy unconquered; no not Death, which will onely be the laſt that ſhall be ſubdued, but ſubdued and deſtroyed it muſt be: ver. 26, 27. Nay, our Lord himſelf acknowledges his Kingdome to be a truſt, when he ſays, xvii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. <hi>Thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternall life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> Whence it is that he often proteſts, <hi>it is his Father's will, that of all he hath given him he ſhould loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day,</hi> &amp;c. vi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 39, 40. <hi>For as the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father; ſo he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me:</hi> ver. 57. And in expreſs terms he ſaith, as I have ſhewn before, that he went away <hi>to prepare a place for us.</hi> And therefore is bound by his office, we may conclude, to promote us to that glory and honour in the heavens, which it is his Father's will, he knows, ſhould be beſtowed on us.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="421" facs="tcp:204181:580"/>4. And who can doubt at all of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in this, who was ſo faithfull in all other things; moſt punctually, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, making good his promiſe of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Holy Ghoſt, as an earneſt, I have often ſaid, of this immortall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? None can imagine he will now prove negligent in that, which by his place he ſtands ingaged to perform; when upon Earth he did the will of him that ſent him with ſuch exactneſs, that he rewarded him for it with that high dignity which he now enjoys in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. Therefore his greateſt care was to aſſert and prove his <hi>power</hi> to give <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Life.</hi> Of his <hi>will</hi> he thought there need not much be ſaid; for none could doubt of it, after they ſaw him die for them, and then expreſs ſuch love, after his reſurrection, as to ſend the Holy Ghoſt upon them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. This is abundantly ſufficient to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure all conſidering perſons of ſo deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Good. Which the Apoſtles began confidently to expect, as ſoon as ever they were ſatisfied of the reſurrection of our Lord from the dead. Before he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to heaven their thoughts ran
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:204181:581"/>thither, and they began to ſee that he was the Lord of life and glory. For as ſoon as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> was convinced by a palpable demonſtration that he was riſen, he cried out, <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi> xx. <hi>Joh.</hi> 28. This is the firſt time that any of his Apoſtles gave him the title of <hi>their GOD;</hi> when they were fully ſatisfied, as <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves, by his Reſurrection, that he would give Eternall Life to them. And then it was alſo, you may note, that he firſt gave them the title of <hi>his Brethren,</hi> who ſhould ſhare with him in the glory to which he was going. xx. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. xxviii. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>Go tell my Brethren that they go into Galilee,</hi> &amp;c. In which words he alludes, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, to thoſe xxii. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare thy name unto my brethren.</hi> He never called them ſo before, till he was after a new manner <hi>declared the Son of God with power by the reſurrection from the dead:</hi> And now to own them for his <hi>Brethren,</hi> was as much as to ſay, that they ſhould be made the <hi>Sons of God</hi> by their reſurrection, and be <hi>coheirs</hi> with him. To prove which new Brotherhood the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> brings that place of the Pſalmiſt now mentioned, ii. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>He is not aſhamed to call
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:204181:581"/>them Brethren, ſaying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren.</hi> Whence he is called the <hi>firſt-born among many brethren,</hi> viii. <hi>Rom.</hi> 29. Whom he bids them that firſt ſaw him alive again inform, that he aſcended <hi>to his God and to their God, and to his Father and their Father:</hi> to ſhew them, that they might ſafely repoſe ſuch a confidence in God as he had done; and hope to be raiſed by him from the dead, as he was, and receive a <hi>portion</hi> with him in the heavenly inheritance.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. This Relation which he owns to us gives us the greateſt confidence to look upon him as <hi>our HOPE,</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 1.) <hi>the HOPE of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 27. For it is certain that when any perſon is advanced to a throne, his bloud is thereby inriched: all his family, I mean, are raiſed and dignified; his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren eſpecially put into the quality of royall perſons, though never ſo mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; nay, made capable of ſucceeding him in his ſtate and greatneſs. Now our Lord hath a family as well as other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; all thoſe who believe on him being acknowledged by him, not onely to be his <hi>brethren,</hi> but his <hi>children:</hi> who, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by his faith, are really deſcended
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:204181:582"/>from him; and therefore <hi>by his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are alſo begotten again unto a lively hope of an incorruptible inheritance.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 3, 4. Whence the ſame Divine Writer, who obſerves how he calls them Brethren, immediately ſhews how he owns a nearer relation to them, ſaying, <hi>Behold, I, and the children which God hath given me:</hi> ii. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. who in him are all advanced to the higheſt honour. His glory makes them illuſtrious: for <hi>if children,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, then heirs; heirs of God, and joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with Chriſt.</hi> viii. <hi>Rom.</hi> 17.</p>
                        <p>Who is not to be conſidered merely as a ſingle perſon, but as the Lord and Head of a Body or Corporation of men; who are ſo one with him, that the raiſing him to ſo great a glory as he inherits, is the raiſing and ennobling them. A ſure pledge, that is, that the ſame ſhall be done for the <hi>Members,</hi> which was for the <hi>Head;</hi> who will not be without them, but make them partakers of the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which is beſtowed on him. He is like the <hi>firſt-fruits,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, (in his Chapter of the Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 20, &amp;c.) a <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> the head and beginning of a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by whom all ſhall as ſurely be

                        <p n="7">7.

This is a very great argument that we have <hi>Eternall Life,</hi> and that it is <hi>in him;</hi> for this Sacrifice of himſelf being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by God, (the <hi>Eternall</hi> SPIRIT, which offered him to God, preſenting him before him without ſpot or blemiſh,) muſt needs take away ſin, and remove all hindrances to our admiſſion into the very ſame place where he is, as that Epiſtle proves at large. <hi>By this offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified; and we have</hi>

To whom therefore we ought to draw near with a true heart, in full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of faith, that he will not fail to imploy his power to make us happy with himſelf. Which, you may conſider once more, he moſt earneſtly prayed for when he was on earth: it being one of his laſt requeſts to his Father, that <hi>thoſe whom he had given him, might be with him where he is; that they might behold the glory which he hath given him.</hi> xvii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 24. And therefore having obtained ſuch a power over all as hath been deſcribed, by his precious bloud which he was then going to offer; we may reſt aſſured he will not let us be without that of which he was ſo deſirous before he left the World, now that he is in heaven with full power to fulfill his own deſires. For it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to ſuppoſe that a Friend, who carneſtly beſeeches another to grant us a favour, will not moſt readily doe it himſelf, when he becomes as able to beſtow it as he of whom before he askt it.</p>
                        <p>But the fear of ſwelling this Treatiſe into over-great a bulk makes me paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe things with the bare mention
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:204181:583"/>of them, and omit many other. I ſhall put an end therefore to this laſt Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the SPIRIT with thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in his <hi>ſecond</hi> Epiſtle, ver. 3, 4. of the <hi>firſt</hi> Chapter: Where he ſaith, as we tranſlate him, that <hi>the Divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godlineſs, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and vertue: whereby are given unto us exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning of which in a larger form of words is plainly this. <q>Account that <hi>grace and peace</hi> which I have wiſht you in abundance (ver. 2.) from God and our Saviour, no ſmall bleſſing: For God hath in a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, omnipotent manner beſtowed on us all things that are neceſſary for our future happineſs and felicity, and for our preſent conduct in piety, which is the onely way to that Eternall life. And if you ask me how he hath given us theſe things in ſo reſplendent, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like a manner; I'le tell you: it is <hi>through the knowledge of him that hath called us;</hi> that is, through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the true <hi>Word</hi> of God, who hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us to piety and happineſs. And if you enquire again, how you ſhall
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:204181:584"/>know that what he ſaith is true, and that he calls us not merely from himſelf, but from God, who directs us by him in the right way of <hi>godlineſs,</hi> which will bring us to everlaſting <hi>Life;</hi> I'll reſolve you in that alſo: for he hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us <gap reason="foreign">

                           </q> How we come to render it <hi>to</hi> glory and vertue, I know not, for it makes the ſenſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; whereas otherwiſe it is perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and clear: and as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, <q>The <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his preaching, or preſently followed it, is a very ſtrong argument to induce you to believe that he taught the way of God in truth; having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed all things pertaining to life and godlineſs, as God himſelf atteſts.</q> For by the <hi>Glory</hi> wherewith he called us, <hi>i. e.</hi> preached the Goſpell and perſwaded us to believe, we are to underſtand his <hi>Transfiguration</hi> on the holy Mount; where <hi>they ſaw his glory:</hi> ix. <hi>Luk.</hi> 32. and to which the Apoſtle afterward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals ver. 16, 17. of this Chapter, as a juſtification of the truth of their Miniſtry. The coming down alſo of the Holy Ghoſt at his Baptiſm, the voices from heaven, (in one of which God ſaid he would <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie</hi>

That is, by his glorious power, as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero</hi> well renders it: for his power ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared moſt gloriouſly in that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Work, whereby, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> here ſpeaks, he called us to believe on him. So we are to underſtand him, it appears by another Argument. For if we ſhould ſay we are called <hi>to glory,</hi> (underſtanding thereby heaven,) we could not be ſaid to have <hi>precious promiſes</hi> (as it follows) <hi>hereby given to us:</hi> For this would be to ſay, that by calling us to heaven he hath called us to heaven. But if we take theſe words the other way, then the ſenſe runs currently, and delivers to us this excellent Truth; <q>That by ſuch means as I have treated of, (the Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, the Transfiguration of our Saviour, the Voices from heaven, the Miracles he wrought, the might of
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:204181:585"/>his power which wrought in him when God raiſed him from the dead,) he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded men to receive him as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-begotten of the Father; who was come, by his authority, to ſhew them the true way to everlaſting life. By theſe we know that we are not cheated, but that he who hath called us is the Son of God; by whom we are ſure to attain everlaſting life, if we follow thoſe directions he hath given us, which will infallibly bring us to it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And then the next words (ver. 4.) are ſtill more pertinent to my purpoſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <q>We are ſo ſure to attain eternall life, that we have many promiſes of it; which are ſo ſtrongly confirmed, that we cannot doubt of them, being delivered in ſuch a divine manner. For when he gave them it was <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, <hi>by glory and vertue,</hi> with ſuch demonſtrations of his Authority to promiſe them, and of his power to make them good, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but depend upon his word.</q> None, I ſuppoſe, queſtion but by theſe <hi>great,</hi> theſe <hi>precious,</hi> yea <hi>exceeding great and precious
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:204181:586"/>promiſes,</hi> he means thoſe of raiſing us from the dead, and carrying us to heaven, to live with God, and that eternally. Theſe are the chiefeſt things of which our Lord hath given us ſuch aſſurance, when he called us to believe on his Name. Things which as much exceed all that was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the heavens are wider then the ſmalleſt ſpot of this earth. More pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious are they then all lands, if they flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with milk and honey: more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired then gold, yea then much fine gold, then all the gold of <hi>Ophir:</hi> more to be valued then the Crowns of Kings, which are not ſo much as an Emmet's Egge in compariſon with this Happineſs. Now as there is nothing that can be compared with theſe promiſes; ſo we have no te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony on Earth comparable to this of the SPIRIT, that exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his power, whereby theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were brought to us, and aſſured to be infallible. For by this we know that He hath all power in heaven and earth, and is able to doe whatſoever the Father Almighty doeth; that is, give life to the dead, which is the property of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty alone. So the Enemies of our Religion are forced to confeſs, who ſay there are <hi>three</hi> keys which God keeps to
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:204181:586"/>himſelf, and commits to none of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, <hi>the keys of the womb, the keys of heaven, and the keys of the grave. Thy power,</hi> ſaith <hi>Joſeph Albo</hi> ſpeaking of God, <hi>is not the power of fleſh and bloud; for the power of fleſh and bloud is to put thoſe to death who are alive, but thy power is to raiſe thoſe to life who are dead.</hi> The very ſame we may juſtly ſay of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who challenges this power to himſelf, as I have noted before out of the <hi>firſt</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where he tells St. <hi>John, I have the keys of hell and of death,</hi> ver. 18. He was no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Embaſſadour, but can doe more then any whom God ſent into the world ever did or could. He can raiſe even the dead bodies of his ſubjects to life again. And when he hath <hi>lifted them out of the duſt,</hi> (if I may apply the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt's words to this purpoſe,) can <hi>ſet them with Princes;</hi> even with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his heavenly Court, to praiſe and bleſs his love among thoſe great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, the Angelicall powers, for ever and ever. Which is a power he doth not aſſume to himſelf vainly, but was conferred on him by God the Father; who <hi>raiſed him from the dead, and gave him glory:</hi> wherein St. <hi>John</hi> beheld him
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:204181:587"/>when he ſaid, <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I live for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Great is thy Majeſty, O thou moſt mighty <hi>Jeſus!</hi> whoſe power is not the power of fleſh and bloud, but the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, who raiſes thoſe to life who are dead. Great was the joy which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thy Diſciples hearts when they firſt ſaw thee alive from the dead, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thee <hi>their God.

                     <p>THere is nothing now wanting to compleat this Diſcourſe, unleſs it be to ſhew that, if the Teſtimony of the APOSTLES of our Lord be at all inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He CAME by Water and Bloud and the Spirit,</hi> (as in the former Treatiſe I proved we have reaſon to think it is,) they alſo bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this Truth; and by them God hath given us this <hi>Record,</hi> that <hi>we have Eternall Life,</hi> and that <hi>this Life is in his Son.</hi>

                     <p>That <hi>Jeſus</hi> had Diſciples the <hi>Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts</hi> themſelves confeſs: who tell us in the ſame place where they ſpeak of his being hanged on the evening of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that they were <hi>five;</hi> MATTHAI,

<pb n="440" facs="tcp:204181:590"/>but to the <hi>Four</hi> Evangeliſts (to which perhaps they have reſpect) they have added one more: and report not one of their names aright, except the firſt; and in the laſt have a little varied from the Name of <hi>Judas</hi> the Brother of St. <hi>James.</hi> But thus much we gain from their own Records, that known Diſciples our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had; who profeſſed to believe on him, and owned him for their Lord and Maſter. Theſe perſons, we can make no queſtion, would be carefull to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the World what they had received from him; becauſe they lookt upon him as the Son of God, and eſtemed his words as ſo many Oracles, which his Crucifixion could not diſparage. Accordingly there are Books that paſs under their Names, beſides the four Goſpels; which no man ever laid any claim to, or pretended to be the Authour of, but onely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and therefore we have no cauſe to think they were not of their indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                     <p>Now if you examine them, you will find that, after his Aſcenſion to heaven, and the coming of the Holy Ghoſt, their buſineſs was to go about and preach this <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>certainty</hi> of it, to all the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:204181:590"/>World, as their Lord and Maſter had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it to them. They were ſo fully perſwaded of it, that they could not forbear to publiſh ſuch glad tidings of great joy to the whole Earth. It was the very end of their Apoſtleſhip, and that which moved them to undertake ſo great a task; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, when he calls himſelf an <hi>Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt by the will of God, according to the promiſe of Life, which is in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 1. appointed by God, that is, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the promiſe of Eternall Life which he had received from <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> who would certainly give it to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on him. And it is the very Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which the other great Apoſtle gives of himſelf, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> v. 1. that he was <hi>a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi> This incouraged him to be a <hi>Witneſs of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt,</hi> as he ſaith juſt before, and not to be daunted, as he had been, though he followed him to a croſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now he clearly ſaw he had a right as a Friend of his (ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>As for the purity of their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which is one part of the Teſtimony of <hi>Water,</hi> I have given an account of it in the firſt part of this Diſcourſe. Which demonſtrates it was of that nature, that it had been an idle attempt to preach it, and endeavour to plant it in the World, had they not believed, and been able to prove, that their Maſter, who employed them, would give them, and all thoſe who obeyed their word, the reward of <hi>Eternall Life.</hi> To which if you adde the holineſs of their <hi>Life,</hi> which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of this Teſtimony, you cannot think that men of ſuch ſincerity in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things would have affirmed ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently as they did that which they did not take to be true; nor have proteſted they ſaw and heard and felt ſuch things as they never had any notice of. But if you will needs ſuppoſe they might be ſo vile, (which is very unreaſonable;) yet who can think they would have denied themſelves ſo much as they did for their Maſter's ſake, in which a great part of their piety conſiſted, if they had not been ſure that he would lead them by
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:204181:605"/>ſuch means to everlaſting life? This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary contempt of all preſent things, even of life it ſelf, as you ſhall hear, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed they were not merely big words which they ſpake, of being with God and our Saviour, to ſee the Glory which the Father had given him; but things which they heartily expected. For does any man find ſuch inclinations in himſelf, as ſhould make him imagine they would have left their trades, their houſes, their poſſeſſions, their wives, kindred, friends, all that is deſirable in this world, and perſwade thoſe who were the deareſt to them to doe ſo too; if they had not had an aſſurance, upon ſuch grounds as were apt to convince others as well as them, of the recompence they ſhould meet withall hereafter in a better life? Who can believe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have quitted all his Dignities, his hopes of greater preferment, his eſteem and reputation with the wiſeſt and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt perſons in the Nation, his eaſe and quiet, and every thing elſe, and betaken himſelf to the troubleſome ſervice of a deſpicable Maſter; if he had not known and ſeen it as clearly as the Sun in the firmament, that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom he ſerved, was raiſed from the dead, and made the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:204181:606"/>King of Glory, and would prefer all thoſe that proved faithfull to him unto the greateſt honour in the heavens? For what reaſon ſhould thoſe good men live <hi>as having nothing,</hi> and all the time be as chearfull as if <hi>they poſſeſſed all things?</hi> Did they not look upon themſelves, think you, as heirs of a Kingdom which could not be taken away from them? Reade St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s deſcription of himſelf to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> (2. iii. 10, 11.) who he ſays <q>had fully known <hi>his doctrine and manner of life,</hi> (not onely what he had been wont to teach, but how he had followed his own inſtructions,) what his <hi>purpoſe</hi> and aim had ever been, his <hi>fidelity,</hi> his <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> towards offenders, his <hi>charity</hi> to all Chriſtians, his <hi>patience</hi> under trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of all ſorts: for he was <hi>perſecuted</hi> and endured great <hi>afflictions</hi> by that means at <hi>Antioch,</hi> (where they thruſt him out of the city,) at <hi>Iconium,</hi> (where an aſſault was made upon him to ſtone him,) at <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> (where they actually ſtoned him.) And in how many other places he had been vilely uſed, <hi>Timothy,</hi> he ſays, could not be ignorant, having been a companion with him in his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels. xvi. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.</q> Now what think you of ſuch a perſon as this? Do you take
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:204181:606"/>him for a dolt and an ignorant ſot? Was this great Apoſtle a mere lump of clay, who was ſenſible of nothing; and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined others ſo ſenſeleſs, as that he might without any reaſon propound this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>Timothy</hi> for his imitation? How came they to be ſo ſtupefied, as to chuſe rods, and whips, and ſtones, and all other miſeries, when they might have lived in eaſe and peace? Nay, to glory in theſe things alone, as if there had been nothing that could have done them ſuch honour, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 5? They did <hi>both hunger and thirſt,</hi> (as I noted from the ſame Apoſtle in my former Book, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 11.) <hi>they were naked and buffetted, they had no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dwelling-place, they laboured working with their own hands, being reviled they bleſſed, being perſecuted they ſuffered it, they were made as the filth of the world, and the off-ſcouring of all things.</hi> Which things no body in his wits can think men of their underſtanding would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, if they had not been provided of <hi>meat</hi> which the world knew not of, and been nouriſhed and ſuſtained with the hope of glory, and aſſured of eternall <hi>manſions</hi> in the heavens, and known that they ſhould inherit <hi>a bleſſing,</hi> and be made more <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> with
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:204181:607"/>
                           <hi>Jeſus</hi> for ever, then the World for the preſent could make them vile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things are ſo clear, that the bare recitall of them is ſufficient to ſatisfie us they were no deceivers, nor men of light belief, who took things upon truſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good evidence; but had the greateſt reaſon to endeavour to <hi>baptize</hi> all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into this belief, as they did by an indefatigable diligence: which was no ſmall teſtimony of the power and glory of the Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi>

                        <p>And their BLOUD ſpeaks as much. For as <hi>none of them,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> xiv. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>lived to himſelf,</hi> ſo <hi>none of them died to himſelf;</hi> but conſecrated even his <hi>bloud</hi> to the Service of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if he pleaſed to command it. Whereby they ſealed to this Truth; and ſhewed they were ſo far from doubting of immortall Life by the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that they unfeignedly deſired to be diſſolved and to be with him. Witneſs St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> who was ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned becauſe he ſaid he ſaw the Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> in the higheſt glory; which he was
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:204181:607"/>never more aſſured of then when he died, for then he recommended his Spirit to him, as our Saviour had done his to God the Father. Witneſs <hi>Antipas,</hi> a faithfull Martyr. Witneſs all thoſe Souls whom St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw beneath the Altar: who had all learnt from our Saviour what they muſt expect in his Service, when he ſaid, <hi>The Brother ſhall deliver up the Brother to death, and the Father the Child; and the Children ſhall riſe up againſt their Parents, and cauſe them to be put to death. And ye ſhall be hated of all men for my Name's ſake.</hi> Under which afflictions they had nothing to ſupport them, but that which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately adds, <hi>He that endureth to the end ſhall be ſaved.</hi> x. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21, 22. Theſe few words were a ſufficient incouragement to them, and made them not regard their lives for the ſake of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> who <hi>hath aboliſhed death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpell. For the which cauſe,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe things, and am not aſhamed; for I know whom I have believed, and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him againſt that day.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 10, 12. And for this cauſe he would not have <hi>Timothy</hi> to be <hi>aſhamed of the teſtimony of our Lord, nor of him his
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:204181:608"/>priſoner;</hi> (ver. 8.) but to imitate him by being <hi>partaker of the afflictions of the Goſpell;</hi> which <hi>he endured,</hi> as he adds in the next Chapter ver. 10. <hi>for the elects ſake, that they alſo might obtain the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in Chriſt Jeſus with eternall glory.</hi> The Apoſtles nothing doubted that <hi>they themſelves</hi> ſhould obtain Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and immortall glory this way: and they hoped likewiſe, by their conſtant ſufferings even to the death, to draw <hi>others alſo</hi> to the faith, or confirm them in it; that they might have a ſhare with them in this happineſs, and be willing to ſuffer for it. <hi>For it is a faithfull ſaying,</hi> he adds, <hi>that if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him: if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him:</hi> ver. 11, 12.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall conclude this with that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 30, 31, 32. where he alledges this among other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to confirm that Church in the belief of the Reſurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come, that He and the reſt of the preachers of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion would not have been ſuch fools, as to have ſuffered in that manner they did, had they not ſeen plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:204181:608"/>of this truth. For they were ſo miſerably treated, that they carried their lives in their hand; and were eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hour, for any thing they knew, at the brink of the grave. He for his part had been compelled to encounter with wild beaſts on the Theatre at <hi>Epheſus:</hi> (ſo ſome ancient Writers underſtand him, who knew there was nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the Pagans then to cry, <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani ad Leones, Away with the Chriſtians to the Lions:</hi> and it was a puniſhment to which the vileſt Malefactors were ſubject, particularly Magicians; as we learn from another <hi>Paul</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">

                           </note> the Lawyer:) or at leaſt he ran as great hazzards as thoſe men did who were expoſed unarmed to the fierceſt creatures, ſuch as Lions, Bears, Tigers, Leopards, wild Boars, and Bulls, and Dogs. (To every one of which we have examples of Chriſtians, in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Story, that were condemned.) And it was for no other cauſe but this, that he preached <hi>Jeſus</hi> and the Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How could they think him ſo ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as to put his life in ſuch danger upon this account, if he was not fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of that for which he ſuffered ſo much; nay, had not good ground to be of this belief? He knew the value of life as well
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:204181:609"/>as other men. He was no ſtone nor block, as I have ſaid, that had no feeling of pain. He naturally loved eaſe and quiet and pleaſure, as well as the reſt of the world. And his education had not been ſuch as to incline him to believe things careleſly; eſpecially ſuch a thing as this, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all his former principles, and as contrary to his preſent preferments and future hopes. And therefore, without imputing to him the higheſt degree of folly and ſtupidity, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> could not disbelieve what he preached of the Life to come. Concerning which he had received ſuch full ſatisfaction, and was convinced of it by ſuch undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arguments; that he choſe rather to loſe his life, then to deny it, or not to preach it.</p>

                        <p>And that He and the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were not deceived nor judged amiſs in this matter, the mighty power of the SPIRIT, which wrought continually in them and with them, abundantly teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This was ſufficient not onely to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy <hi>them,</hi> but to ſatisfy the reſt of the world, that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as they ſaid, was alive,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:204181:609"/>and made the Lord of all: who was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at hand on all occaſions to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this Truth when they preacht it, that he would give <hi>Eternall Life</hi> unto his followers. This power of the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT going along with them was a thing ſo notorious, that the Pagans in ſome places cried out, <hi>the GODS are come down to us in the likeneſs of men;</hi> and could ſcarce be reſtrained from doing divine honours to them. xiv. <hi>Act.</hi> 11, 18.

When the veil of the Temple was rent in ſunder, God, who dwelt in the Holy place, left his habitation, and went out at that breach to return no more thither.

                        <p>By theſe they proved that he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted at God's right hand, and ſate, as he ſaid he would, on the throne of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And their proof was the ſtronger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no great thing done (as formerly there had) but onely what was wrought by their hands; who reigned now with him as ſo many Princes, and <hi>ſate on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael.</hi> xix. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. xxii. <hi>Luk.</hi> 30. They were ſupreme Governours (whoſe office it is to <hi>judge</hi>) in the Church under our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it plainly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the mighty power wherewith their Goſpell was accompanied. Which came, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> not
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:204181:610"/>in <hi>word</hi> onely, but in <hi>power and in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> That is, in Miraculous works, and in extraordinary gifts, which brought along with them <hi>a full aſſurance:</hi> inſomuch that he left it to them to tell the world <hi>what manner of men they were among them.</hi> And if any enquire what was the effect of it, he tells us, that they were perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by this miraculous power, <hi>to turn from idols, to ſerve the living and true God; and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raiſed from the dead, even Jeſus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> i. 9, 10. This was the fruit of their labours and travels, to convince a number of people, by wonderfull opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the ſick, nay upon the dead, and by gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> was raiſed from the dead, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Eternall life in the heavens; from whence he will come to beſtow it upon the faithfull; whom he will never ſuſſer to periſh, but reſcuing them from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, make them ever happy with himſelf.</p>
                        <p>And whoſoever afterward revolted from this Faith, I may adde, and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to oppoſe it, the Apoſtles ſhewed their power (which was a great witneſs
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:204181:611"/>to Chriſtianity) as much in their plagues and puniſhments, as in the cures they wrought upon others. It may well be thought, that thoſe in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church who did not believe the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, were reclaimed from their errour by that Letter which St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to them; for we hear nothing of it more in the next Epiſtle. But ſome there were in other places that obſtinately perſiſted in their folly; and not contented to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what the Apoſtles taught in this matter, contradicted and blaſphemed it. Two of them are named in the 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 17, 18. <hi>Hymeneus and Philetus,</hi> who taught <hi>that the Reſurrection was paſt,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently denied the rewards of the Life to come. The occaſion of their <hi>erring</hi> thus <hi>from the faith</hi> ſeems to have been this, that the Apoſtles often ſpeaking of a ſpirituall reſurrection from a ſtate of ſin to the life of godlineſs, (<hi>Rom.</hi> vi. <hi>Col.</hi> iii.) which they ſuppoſed all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had already felt; theſe men fanſied there was no other, affirming the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was paſt, and none to come. If they had onely doubted of it, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, it is like, would not have ſo ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed them, no more then he did the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> But <hi>they blaſphemed,</hi> as
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:204181:611"/>he expreſly tells us of <hi>Hymeneus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 20. that is, reproached this Doctrine as a fooliſh opinion; and reviled, it is like, the Apoſtles who were the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of it. And therefore he inflicted on them the moſt grievous puniſhment, by <hi>delivering them up to Satan:</hi> which was not ſo little as merely baniſhing them the Chriſtian Society, but turning them over to the power of the Devill, <gap reason="foreign">

For that's the reaſon this puniſhment is called <hi>delivering up to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;</hi> becauſe it viſibly appeared by ſome plagues on the body, that they were faln under his power, by being thrown out of the Church. He was as a common Galoer and Executioner in a City or Kingdome; the Apoſtles as the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Governours, (as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,)
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:204181:612"/>ſitting upon thrones to judge and paſs ſentence on men: either by giving the Holy Ghoſt to thoſe who ſincerely believed; or by delivering thoſe to be tormented and ſet on the rack by this Evill ſpirit, who blaſphemed the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion. There was then no other power in the Church to correct and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them for ſo high a crime; and this being done <hi>by the power of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> (as you reade 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 4.) was a notable teſtimony of the SPIRIT to the truth of Chriſtianity, and bad all men beware how they ſpake evill of this holy Doctrine: eſpecially of this fundamentall part of it, that the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> will give us everlaſting life, and raiſe us up at the laſt day. The terrible execution which they ſaw done upon thoſe who ſubverted this foundation of all piety, was a great means to confirm all Chriſtian people in the faith: and to make them reverence thoſe who had this mighty power, either to give men eaſe, or to torment them; to reſtore men to life, or to ſtrike them dead; to give them, as was ſaid before, the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, or to put them into the poſſeſſion of the Devill.</p>

By that glorious ſight he was fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; and, ſtanding as firm as a rock himſelf, confirmed others in that faith, which made him ſo invincible, that he <hi>gloried</hi> and <hi>took pleaſure</hi> in all thoſe <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and reproaches, and neceſſities, and perſecutions, and diſtreſſes,</hi> which that Angel of Satan ſtirred up againſt him: ver. 9, 10. That was all the Devill got by his ill uſage of him, which onely gave the Apoſtle matter of glory. For when our Saviour pleaſed not to grant his deſire of having this Angel removed, but onely told him <hi>his grace ſhould be ſufficient for him;</hi> immediately he adds,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:204181:613"/>that he would <hi>gladly glory more then ever in his afflictions.</hi> Which plainly ſhews, both what he meant by that <hi>Angel of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;</hi> and how much hereby the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion was promoted, and the Souls of believers ſtrengthened in the faith. They might eaſily believe he had been in the <hi>third heavens,</hi> when they ſaw him ſo much ſuperiour to all the power on earth, and the powers of the air too; who conſpired to beat him down and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs him.

Why ſhould ſuch offenders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the comfort of hoping for ſo great a Happineſs, while we are here in theſe earthly priſons?

                        <p>And what is it that he hath ſo freely promiſed? To look into that high and holy place where he is? at ſome diſtance to behold his glory? to have an Angel come ſometimes to viſit us, and bring us ſome meſſage from him in ſome of the ſuburbs of heaven? And a great favour too, I aſſure you. A very ſingular kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ought to be eſteemed, if we vile wretches may be permitted to be ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as but to come near the gates of the celeſtiall palace.

<pb n="502" facs="tcp:204181:621"/>reign together with him in his heavenly Kingdom, and be equall to the Angels, and enter into the joy of our Lord, and continue with him for ever. <hi>What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of love is this, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God; and being like him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him as he is!</hi> Where is our love? whither is it run? after what is it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, if it be not here ready to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this kindneſs, in making us ſuch <hi>great,</hi> ſuch <hi>exceeding great and precious</hi> promiſes? Ah me! that we ſhould have loſt our ſelves ſo much, as not to find our affections forward to meet ſuch a love as this, with the higheſt tranſport of joy!

                        <p>Ah bleſſed <hi>Jeſus!</hi> that thou ſhouldſt be pleaſed to doe ſo much for thoſe, whoſe hearts thou kneweſt to be ſo cold, that they would ſcarce be warmed with the brighteſt beams of thine inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble love!

Here are WITNES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES of the higheſt quality to atteſt the truth of his Love: by whom <hi>we know that the Son of God is come, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us an underſtanding that we may know him that is true,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is the true God, and Eternall Life.</hi> And as if <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> were not ſufficient, here are <hi>ſix</hi> Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes come to tell us how he loves us. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth conſpire to draw our hearts to be love of him; who hath not onely given us exceeding great <hi>Promiſes,</hi> but exceeding great <hi>Certainty</hi> that they are all true and faithfull. He knew very well they would ſeem incredible; being as much beyond all our thoughts, as they are beyond our deſerts. And therefore he took care to give us ſuch evidences of
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:204181:622"/>their truth, as ſhould not merely work in us belief, but a full aſſurance of faith. By <hi>Himſelf,</hi> by his <hi>Word,</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> by the <hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>Bloud,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> we are ſo many ways rooted and grounded in this perſwaſion, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee we are doubly beholden to his infinite bounty: firſt, for ſuch excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great and precious promiſes; and then, for as wonderfully great confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, to our unſpeakable and endleſs comfort.</p>
                        <p>And are we not yet apprehenſive of his love? Doth it not yet feelingly touch our hearts; but leave us indifferent whether we will love him or not? Ah fools that we are! who muſt be ſent to ſchool to thoſe brute creatures mentioned before, to teach us better nature and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manners. How do our very dogs (as I have ſaid elſewhere) follow us and fawn upon us for a cruſt of bread? how cloſe do they keep to us? how ready are they to defend us and our houſes, and all belonging to us? Even when we are dead, ſome of them have been known not to forſake their Maſters for any other. And what is all this ſervice for, but ſuch things as we have no uſe of, or make no
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:204181:622"/>account of our ſelves? O bleſſed God! who can endure to ſtay ſo long as to hear this applied to himſelf, before he learn to love thee? I ſee whither this leſſon tends: I behold already how ſhamefull it is to diſpoſe of my heart away from thee. Thou haſt given us thine own dear Son: What a gift! how great a boon! Thou haſt promiſed us eternall life: How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable a poſſeſſion! Thou haſt given us good hopes and ſtrong conſolation: What an exceſſive kindneſs! Shall we not devote our ſelves to thee? ſhall we not forſake all, and follow thee, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever thou wilt lead us? We cannot refuſe: we muſt reſolve to ſurrender our hearts intirely to thee. We ſhould be worſe then Dogs, ſhould we not with all our minds and ſoul and ſtrength love that tranſcendent goodneſs, which by the moſt miraculous demonſtrations hath perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us, that we ſhall live eternally with himſelf, and enjoy the everlaſting fruits of his infinite love. This is the moſt comfortable news that could poſſibly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from heaven. Should we have had our own wiſhes, nothing greater, nothing ſo great could have entred into our hearts deſire. This ſweetens the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all afflictions, and this heightens
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:204181:623"/>all our joys; when we hope the one ſhall ſhortly, but the other ſhall never end.</p>

                           <hi>Plutarch</hi> deſervedly blamed <hi>Epicurus</hi> of great incogitancy, who, making all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conſiſt in Pleaſure, denied the ſtate of the future life: which it is the greateſt pleaſure to hope for and expect. Nothing caſts ſuch a damp upon all a man's enjoyments here, as the cold thoughts of an endleſs death ſeizing on his heart. He cannot but ſigh to think that ſhortly there muſt be a finall period put to all his delights. As on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, this gives life and ſpirit to them, if he can think they ſhall be improved and perpetuated for ever. And therefore how much do we owe to the love of God, who hath given us aſſurance even of the Reſurrection of our body to an immortall life; and told us, it ſhall be ſo far from being loſt by going to the grave, that, like Seed, it ſhall riſe again quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing then it was when caſt into the ground? no longer weak, contemptible, corruptible and mortall; but power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſpirituall, glorious, incorruptible and immortall: and conſequently ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of purer, more ſpritely, and more

<pb n="530" facs="tcp:204181:635"/>No man had ſo much as a thought or a deſire of ſuch things as God hath done for us, and intends to doe by our Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi> That he ſhould ſend from heaven his own Son, his onely-begotten Son, begotten of him before all worlds, to be incarnate of a pure Virgin, to die for our ſins, that he might riſe again to ſit at God's right hand, where our Nature ſhines far brighter then all the glorious hoſt of heaven, are ſuch things as they had no imagination of who expected the coming of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Much leſs did they think of being ſo promoted by him in his heavenly Kingdome, that they ſhould at laſt arrive at the ſame glory; and this clod of earth ſhould be lifted up to the dwellings of Angels, and there be faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned like unto the glorious body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf.

                        <p>Then indeed, in thoſe old times, was the Infancy of the World; and being little <hi>Children,</hi> (though they were <hi>heirs,</hi> yet) they differed not much from Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. They knew not what their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Unto that growth we are now arrived, who have the knowledge of God's grace in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> We are now the Sons of God: and though it do not appear (as I ſaid before) how we ſhall be his Sons hereafter; yet this we know, that we ſhall be like him when he appears; for we ſhall ſee him as he is. And therefore we cannot refrain from crying out again, <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us.</hi> Let us admire it, let us adore it; for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there ſuch love.</p>

                        <p>But it is not ſufficient onely to admire this incomparably tranſcendent love; which naturally excites in the hearts of thoſe that conſider it ſuch an ardent reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall affection, as leads them to an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall chearfull obedience to God's will. That's the proof our Saviour juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of our unfeigned love to him. He would have us, if we be truly ſenſible of the kindneſs he hath done us, not

                           <hi>labour</hi> ſo much <hi>for the meat that periſheth,</hi> as <hi>for the meat that endureth unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, which he will give unto us.</hi> Take any pains, that is, to be ſo happy as he deſigns to make us: which no man can refuſe who hath once <hi>ſet</hi> his <hi>affections,</hi> not <hi>on things</hi> beneath, but on thoſe <hi>which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God.</hi> And this he may well expect we will doe, now that he hath ſo clearly demonſtrated where our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs lies, and given us ſuch aſſurance that he lives for ever to bring us to it. This will move us, if any thing in the world can do it, to come when he invites us, to take his yoke upon us, and ſtoop to his burthen; ſo ſhall we find reſt to our Souls. This Eternall life, as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Record tells us, is onely <hi>in the Son of God:</hi> part of the meaning of which words is, that onely by the Religion which our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath taught us is this great Good to be obtained. This is teſtified to us by God as much as any thing elſe, that there is no way to be happy but by his Son <hi>Jeſus;</hi> who hath ſhewn us the onely means to obtain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, honour and immortality, is by patient continuance in well doing.

                        <p>Which demonſtrates again the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable love of God, in revealing thoſe things to us which are ſo neceſſary for the ſecuring and promoting our preſent hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in this World. Where, as we could not be ſafe without the belief of a Life to come; ſo this alone is ſufficient to make the whole World moſt happy, if it were deeply planted in it. We are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely therefore indebted to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty goodneſs for making this ſo certain. For this World would be a place full of nothing but confuſion, diſorder and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, were not the evill inclinations of men over-ruled by a belief of ſomething to follow in another life. This reſtrains them from thoſe outrages, which their power many times inables them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit with impunity while they are here. Their bold and violent ſpirits are check'd and curb'd, whenſoever they think there
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:204181:639"/>is a greater Lord then they, who will call them to an account. Bleſſed be God therefore, we have all reaſon to ſay, who hath ſo evidently demonſtrated there is a Life to come, after we go from hence; and, by the reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> from the dead, aſſured us he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a day wherein he will judge the world in righteouſneſs. This belief not onely reſtrains men from doing evill, but, which is much more, will even force them to doe well. It alone is ſufficient, as I ſaid, to make the World happy, did we throughly entertain it. Let a man but believe ſtedfaſtly there is a Life to come in another world, and you need not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him how to behave himſelf here. That one Principle will teach him to make an exact difference between good and evill; and awaken his Soul to attend to thoſe directions which he finds there, for the regulating his actions towards God and man. And this it doth with ſuch a force, that as a man cannot be ignorant, if he think of this, what he ought to doe on all occaſions; ſo neither his naturall propenſion to ſin, nor his evill cuſtoms, nor corrupt doctrines, nor the common received faſhions among men, nor mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of parts, nor multitude of buſineſs,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:204181:640"/>nor the conceived difficulty of Religion, will be able to hinder that man from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he ought, whoſe breaſt is poſſeſſed with the thoughts of immortall life. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nobility nor meanneſs of birth, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches nor poverty of eſtate, freedom nor ſervitude of condition, thirſt of glory nor fear of contempt, the praiſe of ſome nor the ſcorn of others, the company of our equals nor the commands of ſuperiours, no gain, no loſs, nothing that we deſire, nothing that we dread, can ſtand before the force of this ſingle argument, if it be ſettled in the heart. For the love of life it ſelf, which is the firſt of all goods that we receive, and the laſt of all that we loſe, is overcome by this, and ſubmits to the diſpoſall of this Eternity of life. So that this is an Univerſall Medicine to purge us of all vicious humours, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and fortifie our Nature, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and comfort the moſt languiſhing and fainting ſpirits. It is an Engine ſtrong enough to remove the moſt ponderous impediments that lie in our way; an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable reaſon for any duty; and ſuch a demonſtration, as not onely perfectly ſatisfies our mind, but, being once ſeated there, will never go out again.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="541" facs="tcp:204181:640"/>The truth of this will be apparent to thoſe that conſider,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That <hi>this Motive alone contains all other whatſoever in it:</hi> there being more in theſe two words, ETERNALL LIFE, then kingdoms, and thrones, and treaſures, and glory, and joy, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch like words can expreſs. By which we may judge what force there is in that to make us doe well, in which the ſtrength of all other arguments, from great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, honour, riches, pleaſure, to engage our affections, are concentred and united. There is as vaſt a difference therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and all other perſwaſives to the will, as between the beams of the Sun when they are gathered in a glaſs, which ſet all combuſtibles that approach them on fire; and the ſame beams ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and diſperſed in the air, when they work onely by their ſingle virtue. By reaſon of which excellency it is, that it meets with every man's deſires, and hath ſomething in it agreeable to his hopes. And to every one of thoſe men of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent deſires, it preſents alſo every thing: So that the ambitious, for example, hath the greateſt glory and honour ſet before
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:204181:641"/>his eyes to invite him to it; with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of pleaſure, joy, peace, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſirable goods. Whereby it breaks the force of all temptations which would divert us from piety; or rather heightens and lifts up our minds above them, as things inconſiderable. For, a man's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit being naturally formed into a likeneſs of the objects with which he is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, his Mind who hath his thoughts in heaven neceſſarily becomes great and heavenly; and is inſpired with ſuch a generous and divine ſenſe, that he is not moved with the ſolicitations of theſe little things here, but overlooks them all, as much below him. He is made ſublime and truly noble by frequent converſation with ſo great a Good; and ſcorns to ſtoop to the lure of thoſe temptations, which have ſuch power upon earthly ſouls.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. For ſuch is the force of this motive, it is manifeſt from hence, that (as I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed in the beginning) <hi>it ſpeaks to the whole man,</hi> and leaves no part of him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched and unſatisfied. The Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding cannot ſay it is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the Will that it is not ſatisfied with loving, nor the Affections that they
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:204181:641"/>are not filled with joy, nor any part of man complain that it wants a ſhare in this Eternall life. For even the Body, we ſaw, ſhall partake of the glory that ſhall be revealed, and be much improved in ſtrength, and beauty, and agility, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſs; being made incorruptible. So that while other, petty goods, do onely ſtill the craving of one deſire, (and that but for a little time,) leaving the reſt diſcontented; this intirely and at once quiets all, and brings in an univerſall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; being the very life of God himſelf. It is deſirable therefore upon its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and for it ſelf alone; there being nothing beyond it (as there is in other goods) for which we ſhould deſire it. We intend by the gaining of any thing here, to come to the poſſeſſion of ſome other good. But it is not ſo in our deſires of Eternall Life; which being the laſt and chiefeſt Good, our thoughts natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt and repoſe themſelves, when they come there, and ſeek no farther. There our hearts ſettle, and no longer rove up and down in uncertainty after every thing we fanſie. For the hope of it gives us a full contentment within our ſelves; and thereby preſerves us from a needleſs purſuit of this and the other enjoyment;
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:204181:642"/>and leaves us little elſe to doe, but to ſecure the inheritance of ſo great a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And that we cannot miſs, if we keep it in our thoughts: for ſo great is the efficacy of this Good, that <hi>it cannot be refuſed.</hi> It is not in our power to ſet it at nought, (as we may do other things, which have ſomething greater then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be their competitors in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;) becauſe it is a Good ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that there is none above it, or equal to it. It will not let us ſo much therefore as deliberate (when we attend to it) whether we will have it or no; but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it ſelf upon us on any terms or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions whatſoever. And can there be a greater motive to doe well then this; which not onely baffles all temptations, and quiets the heart ſo that it need not gad abroad after every little thing in this world; but alſo quite takes away all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to reject it, and leaves us no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to chuſe whether or no we will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it? Anſwer me in your own thoughts; What is there more perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive then that, which we can have no will at all, if we mind it, to deny? Such is the condition of <hi>Eternall Life,</hi> which
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:204181:642"/>inclines the will, juſt as a talent doth the ſcales, when there is nothing but air in the contrary balance, without any the leaſt hovering or deliberation which way to turn. And were it alway preſent to us, it would wholly deprive us of all our liberty to doe otherwiſe then it would have us. By reaſon indeed of its being in expectation hereafter, and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſenſible to us now onely by ſerious thoughts, a ſtrong and lively faith, and by the power of the Holy Ghoſt; the will of man retains a liberty, (which while this Good is before him he is quite deſpoiled of,) whereby he too often chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes other things before this Eternall life. But were it not for this, he could not chuſe but embrace it intirely: which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently manifeſts the force of it in its own nature, if we will but be at the pains, by conſideration, faith, and prayer for the Holy Spirit of God, to bring it into frequent view and ſet it before us. And what is there imaginable of greater efficacy to move us to ſuch conſtant dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to bring it near to our hearts then this, that when we ſee it, our wills have no power to be indifferent, either to it, or the well-doing which leads unto it. Nay, I may adde this; So great is the
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:204181:643"/>force of this argument, that, though one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the abſence of it ſome time from our thoughts can make it poſſible we ſhould periſh; yet the Will, being mightily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with its preſence, doth not onely love it, but lays its commands upon the mind alſo to inquire and adviſe more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly about the way to attain it at laſt, by preſerving a conſtant ſenſe of it at preſent. It hath no liſt to part with ſo great a Good; and therefore excites the Underſtanding to find out the means to keep and maintain a lively apprehenſion of it, and requires it to be carefull and diligent in the continuall uſe of thoſe means.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And truly it is ſuch a Good (by which alſo you may judge how forcible a motive it is) as <hi>makes all means whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whereby we may attain it, lovely and deſirable.</hi> There is no Rule more known then this, that the End we deſign pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails with us to love thoſe Means, which we would not love for themſelves. As the hope of having our health reſtored, makes bitter pills and diſtaſtfull potions go down well enough. But what is there, except perhaps the deſire of ſaving our lives, which will render every thing
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:204181:643"/>whatſoever acceptable? It is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of this Good alone, to diſpoſe a man to refuſe nothing, no not death it ſelf, that he may enjoy it. It commands over all the evill things in this world, as well as over the good; and makes a man wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to endure the one, as well as turn away from the invitation of the other. It makes the greateſt <hi>ends</hi> a man hath in this world to ſubmit to ſerve as <hi>means</hi> to bring us to it. And what will you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of greater virtue then that, which will be received by all means? Suppoſe a man ſhould be content to loſe his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and recreations, and health too, for the getting riches; which is all he aims at while he lives: but ſee here a Good which will make him willing to loſe them too, for ſo glorious a purchace. Or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man will chuſe to loſe all his worldly goods which he hath got, that he may preſerve his liberty, and not be inſlaved: here is a greater Good ſtill, which will diſpoſe a man to kiſs his cords or his chains, and ſing, like <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> in the innermoſt priſon. Or ſuppoſe again, that, to ſave his life, a man ſhould embrace the chains and fetters which tie him faſt to his oar: nere is ſomething ſtill beyond this, which is the onely thing that
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:204181:644"/>can make a man chearfully ſacrifice his life; for the loſs of which nothing elſe can make him any recompence. The reaſon is, becauſe there is no proportion between this and all other things, either as to greatneſs, or goodneſs; not ſo much as between a Kingdom and a barly-corn.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And therefore I may adde, that <hi>it will make us in love with all piety at once;</hi> and with all the means leading to it, though never ſo troubleſome. It doth not work upon us after the way of Art, but as Nature it ſelf doth. It doth not teach us vertue and godlineſs by little parcels, as a Statuary firſt forms one part of his ſtatue, and then another, now wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on the face, and then on the hands or feet; but inſtills it altogether in the whole maſs, (as I may ſo ſpeak,) and works in us ſuch an univerſall love to goodneſs, as to have a ready will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to doe whatſoever God would have us. Juſt as you ſee the ſpirit of Nature or a particular Soul work in the formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body of a plant, or of an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall in the womb; which it begins in all its proportions together, and ſo proceeds on ſtill to bring the parts to a greater bigneſs and ſtrength: even ſo doth this
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:204181:644"/>mighty Good operate when it touches the heart, not inclining it firſt to the grace of temperance, and then by another touch to the grace of charity, and after that by a third to the grace of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs, &amp;c. but at once begets an hearty love to univerſall goodneſs, and forms the whole body of Chriſtian Vertues all together; which grow up after the ſame manner all alike, there being the ſame power inſpiring us unto all. Which may ſpare me the labour of ſhewing what a Motive it is to inforce the practice of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular Vertue. Which it makes eaſie alſo; becauſe this one thing, which is the reaſon for all, is eaſily kept in our mind. <hi>Eternall Life</hi> is like a ſhort Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which contains in it the pith and ſtrength of a long Diſcourſe: or like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a little Leaven, which infuſes it ſelf into the whole maſs wherewith it is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And it makes all Divine graces intire and perfect alſo. For where the mind is once impregnated with it, and it hath begun a Divine life there, it will never produce a monſtrous birth. No lim of the New man, if I may ſo ſpeak, ſhall here be wanting. It will not ſuffer us, I mean, to be defective in any part of true piety; nor ſhall one part draw all
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:204181:645"/>the nouriſhment to it, and overgrow the reſt. It will not let us ſpend our zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome particulars, while we are cold and remiſs in other Chriſtian duties; but make us equally affected and ſpirited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all. From whence likewiſe ariſes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefit; that while, by the thoughts of this, we excite our ſelves to any one grace, we promote our growth alſo in every one. When we ſtir up our ſelves to the practice of our preſent duty, we are diſpoſed thereby to the like chearfull obedience on any other emergent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. When we call up our Souls by this to doe God's will, it impowers us alſo (though we ſhould not then think of it) to ſuffer what he would have us. And while we animate our ſelves hereby to ſuffer one thing, it enables us to doe and ſuffer all.</p>
                        <p>O the power of this Divine Good, if it once ſeat it ſelf in the very throne of our hearts! How it makes them beat with the love of God, and with the love of our neighbour! How it inſpires us with reſolution, with confidence, with zeal, with joy, with all other pious affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! It will let us ſcruple none of God's Commands, becauſe it is of equall
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:204181:645"/>force to make us ſubmit to all. Neither prophaneneſs nor hypocriſy, neither liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs nor deſpondency, can ever lodge in that heart where this belief is deeply rooted; that God will give to our little ſhort labours here, an immenſe eternall recompence in the other World.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. One cannot imagine how it ſhould be otherwiſe, if we go on to conſider once more how naturally <hi>this belief fills our hearts with love</hi> to that bleſſed God, who is ſo good as to deſign us ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Bleſſedneſs; and to his will, as the onely way and means to be partaker of it. We ſhall eaſily be perſwaded that the Will of him who promiſes us immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality muſt needs be the Rule of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It will never enter into our hearts to ſuſpect, that he who loves us ſo much can enjoyn us any thing but what is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good for us. And ſo our wills and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections will readily bow and ſtoop to his, without any diſpute at all about it.</p>
                        <p>But I have ſaid too much already about this buſineſs, to have any room left for a new argument of the power of this great Good.</p>

                        <p>Let us proceed rather to conſider what the matter is, that a Motive in it ſelf ſo great and ſo powerfull ſhould have ſo little power upon mens hearts, to move them to vertue and goodneſs. One may juſtly wonder at it, and ask, What is the cauſe that men are ſo dull, ſo ſluggiſh, ſo backward to doe well, ſince the reward is ſo certain, ſo tranſcendent; and it is as certain they will miſs of it in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way but this of vertue and piety? Where is the <hi>Violence</hi> which the holy Goſpel ſpeaks of, and which in all reaſon was to be expected when the Kingdom of heaven was opened? One would have thought, upon the report of ſo great a Bleſſedneſs, men would have throng'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven; and with eager violence ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to thruſt in themſelves before others into ſuch preferment as was offered them in our Saviour's Kingdom. His Diſciples, ſure, thought that men could not chuſe, when they heard ſuch news, but all flock to his fold, and prepare themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his bleſſing. And there have been thoſe
<note n="*" place="margin">Maldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>and</hi> de Celada.</note> who have fanſied the Apoſtles were ſo poſſeſſed with theſe thoughts, that this
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:204181:646"/>was the reaſon they were troubled to hear our Saviour ſay, <hi>whither he went, they could not go;</hi> (that is, at preſent; xiii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 33.) becauſe they imagined all would run ſo thick towards the Bliſs which he promiſed, that if they went not to heaven with him then, it was to be queſtioned whether there would be any room left for them, and all places might not be taken up before they came. And to comfort them, our Saviour, ſay they, bid them <hi>not be troubled, for in his father's houſe were many Manſions:</hi> (xiv. 1, 2.) that is, there was room for all comers, though never ſuch multitudes. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe indeed of our Saviour there ſhews that this is but a fancy: yet if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the haſte men make in any other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous offers, and how they will ſtrive to prevent and circumvent one another, to gain any preferment here in this world; they might well think that men would come in as great crowds to heaven, as we have ſeen them ſometime come to Church; and would all run as men do in a race, contending earneſtly who ſhould carry away the crown. For <hi>bonorum quorundam, ſicut &amp; malorum, eſt intolerabilis magnitudo;</hi> the greatneſs of ſome goods, as well as of ſome evills, is
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:204181:647"/>ſo exceſſive and intolerable, (as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> if I forget not, ſomewhere ſpeaks,) that it weighs down all that can be caſt into the ſcale againſt it; and ſuffers not our wills, as you have heard, to deliberate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. Whence is it then that we ſee ſo little care and concern about that <hi>far more exceeding eternall weight of glory?</hi> that good which is ſo vaſt, that in this ſtate we cannot bear the very thoughts of it? In ſtead of that forwardneſs which might have been expected, there is a ſtrange backwardneſs ſo much as to think of theſe things. A prodigious numneſs and ſtupidity hath ſeized on the hearts of Chriſtian people, who ſeem to have no life at all in them. To what ſhall we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it; ſeeing the Sun of righteouſneſs hath ſhone ſo brightly and ſtrongly on them, with theſe chearfull beams of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Life, which he hath brought to light through his Goſpell?</p>
                        <p>Is there any thing here that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to vie with the <hi>Eternall Life</hi> he hath revealed? I will not ſtay for an Anſwer, the diſparity is ſo great between this and all other goods. What is it then which makes men ſo indifferent? Is there little or no hope that God will beſtow ſuch
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:204181:647"/>great and glorious things, upon ſuch vile wretches as we are? No; he hath <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,</hi> and <hi>prepared</hi> them, as you have heard; and he cannot be worſe then his word, nor loſe all his own preparations. What is it then that ſtifles their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after this immortall bliſs? Will he not give it but upon very hard terms, and ſuch rigorous conditions as are enough to freez the warmeſt reſolutions, when we think of them? Not this neither: For he hath prepared theſe good things <hi>for thoſe that love him.</hi> And what is there more eaſie, what more pleaſant and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then love? eſpecially of the firſt and chiefeſt Good? which will certainly make all our duty as eaſie and delightfull as it ſelf is. Or will you ſay, that we cannot love him; it is an impoſſible Condition? For ſhame conſider, that the very offer of ſuch glorious things is enough to make us love him intirely, if we did believe them. Were we perſwaded that he will beſtow upon good men ſuch happineſs with himſelf, ſo great, ſo long; it would inflame our hearts with the moſt ardent paſſion towards his ſervice. Therefore I have already named the true cauſe of all mens coldneſs and ſloth. After all our ſearch, we ſhall find it nothing elſe but
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:204181:648"/>this, They do not believe. They are not perſwaded of the certainty of the rewards in the other World, or have not fixed this belief in their Minds: for if they had, it would not eaſily ſlip out again. They are moved ſtrongly by what they ſee with their eyes, and feel with their hands, and taſte with their tongues; but faith hath little or no place or power in their hearts. This is proved to be too true by the lives of men; which are ſo baſe and unworthy, as if they did not hope for the happineſs of a fly in the other World.</p>
                        <p>Therefore every one of our buſineſs muſt be, to awaken that faith in our Souls which we profeſs; that Divine principle, which is of ſuch force as to overcome the World. For it is manifeſtly true, which the Apoſtle writes, that <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> We ſhall never doe any thing worthy of him, unleſs we believe that God is, and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him. As, on the contrary, it is no leſs manifeſt that, if we do believe, we ſhall not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſe him, but we ſhall pleaſe our ſelves in doing ſo, and find it moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to be religious. It will marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly inliven us, and infuſe, as it were,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:204181:648"/>a new ſpirit and ſoul into us: ſo that we ſhall differ as much from our ſelves, as the corn doth when it is ſown in the ground, and when it ſhoots up again in all its verdure and beauty. It will make us adorn our ſelves, I mean, with all the fruits of righteouſneſs; and beget in us ſuch a ſpirituall life, as will fructify and increaſe in all good works.</p>
                        <p>And here conſider, <hi>firſt,</hi> That the things themſelves propounded to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief are ſuch, as we cannot but deſire it ſhould be true, that God intends to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them on us. Who is there that would not willingly live for ever? that doth not think Immortality the greateſt prerogative of humane Nature? provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded we may live always in joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in uninterrupted contentments, and never-fading delights. Though they ſhould be leſs then our Lord hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there is no heart but above all things wiſhes to be ſo happy. To ſee onely the beautifull orders of the heavenly hoſts, the glorious Company of the Apoſtles, the goodly Society of the Prophets, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army of Martyrs, the venerable Quire of Paſtors, the whole multitude of holy men and women, who celebrate a
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:204181:649"/>perpetuall feaſt of joy; to live in happy friendſhip with them, to love them, and to be beloved of them; to bear a part in their eternall Song of praiſe and thanks to God; how deſirable is it above any thing that we can fanſy in this world? No man hath ſo little love to himſelf, as not to wiſh he might be numbred among thoſe Saints in glory everlaſting. It's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible we ſhould not be pleaſed with the thoughts of having a conſortſhip in ſuch an incomparable happineſs; were we but perſwaded that it is not a dream, but a reall truth. There needs nothing more to bring it into all mens favour, but onely to be ſatisfied that there is ſuch an Happineſs.</p>
                        <p>And that's the <hi>other</hi> thing I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to your thoughts; That as we naturally deſire ſuch an Happineſs, ſo, if we conſider the evident demonſtations we have of it in the Goſpell, this and a great deal more appears to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted inheritance of all good Souls; who ſhall <hi>ſee God,</hi> and <hi>be with our Lord,</hi> and <hi>behold his glory.</hi> Which wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommends the Chriſtian Religion to us; wherein we are gratified in our moſt important deſires, and have thoſe things made ſure and certain to us
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:204181:649"/>which we would all fain have for our portion. For what is the generall intent of the Goſpell, but to diſcover to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind immortall life, and the way to it? This was the great end of our Saviour's appearing; who brought that glimmering light that was in mens minds, of the other world, to a more perfect day. And upon this errand the Apoſtles were ſent, as you have heard, <hi>to call men to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> ii. 14. Which made the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo unexcuſable that they <hi>would not come unto our Lord, that they might have life;</hi> (v. <hi>Joh.</hi> 40.) though there was the greateſt reaſon in the world to believe this Record, that <hi>God hath given us Eternall life; and this life is in his Son.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A <hi>voice</hi> from heaven, I have ſhewn you, often teſtified as much: and ſo did the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which deſcended on our Saviour at his baptiſm; and the many <hi>ſigns</hi> and <hi>wonders</hi> whereby God the Father <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him,</hi> and ſet, as it were, his mark, ſtamp and character upon him; that all might know who he was, and believe his word as undoubtedly, as if they heard God the Father himſelf ſpeaking to them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with his own voice out of heaven. From thence our Saviour came, it was
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:204181:650"/>apparent; and therefore did not pretend to diſcover things of which he had no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge, but onely revealed that happy Country from whence he deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. So he profeſſes to a very wiſe man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> who was convinced, by his many Miracles, that he was a Teacher come from God; iii. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. <hi>Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I ſay unto thee, We ſpeak that we do know, and teſtify that we have ſeen:</hi> ver. 11. For as he came down from heaven; (as he farther tells him ver. 13.) ſo at that very moment he was there, and had a moſt intimate familiarity and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation therewith: and therefore might well ſay, he <hi>had ſeen</hi> the things he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from thence. What they were, you may reade in the following verſes, 15, 16. <hi>That whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The very ſame, as I have likewiſe ſhewn, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> teſtified, ver. 36. And ſo did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias;</hi> who appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in glory, and diſcourſed with him concerning his return to the other world, after he had done the will of God here. ix. <hi>Luke</hi> 30, 31. At that time our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was <hi>transfigured,</hi> (an evident
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:204181:650"/>token of the glorifying even of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in the other ſtate,) as three perſons of integrity witneſs; who <hi>ſaw his glory,</hi> and the two men that ſtood with him, ver. 32. and were themſelves overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a bright cloud, (an emblem of the glory to come in another World,) and ſo raviſht with the ſight, that they wiſht they might always remain in that happy place. Neither was this onely a ſudden tranſport; but it made ſuch a laſting impreſſion upon their minds, that ever after they lookt upon it as a notable proof of the majeſty and glory of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 16, 17. And ſo did the ancient Chriſtians; as appears by the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack</hi> Tranſlatour of the New Teſtament, who before the Epiſtle of St. <hi>James</hi> takes notice, that now follow the Epiſtles of the <hi>three</hi> Diſciples before whom our Lord was transfigured.</p>
                        <p>This we are to mark diligently, and take it for an eminent token of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to which our Lord was to go, and which he ſhould be able to give. For it relies upon the report of thoſe who were perſons of known worth, and uprightneſs of heart; who had no deſign in the world to ſerve, but onely to promote ſuch an
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:204181:651"/>important truth, of which they were fully aſſured. They appeal to all that had any acquaintance with them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever they ſaw or had reaſon to ſuſpect any falſe or double dealing in them; and had not rather been witneſſes of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and ſimplicity in the whole courſe of their Miniſtry. <hi>For we are not, as many,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 17. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="563" facs="tcp:204181:651"/>good of Souls, when they intend nothing but to get their money:) <hi>nor do we walk in craftineſs,</hi> appearing one thing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another; <hi>nor corrupt the word of God,</hi> by mixing any of our own inventions with it; but in a free, open and plain manner <hi>we commend our ſelves to all mens conſciences, as having God looking on us.</hi> All that know us cannot but approve us; (if they be not led by paſſion more then reaſon;) and if they do not, God doth. This he repeats again, <hi>Chap.</hi> vi. where he gives a proof of their ſincerity, in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, from theſe two things; <hi>firſt,</hi> that they got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by it, but many afflictions; and <hi>then,</hi> that they did nothing but good to others, in recompence for all the trouble they gave them. Of the former he ſpeaks ver. 4, 5. of the ſecond, ver. 6, 7. and then returns to the other again. Which argument he handles alſo at large towards the concluſion of the ſame Epiſtle, xi. 23, 24, &amp;c. and once more xii. 10.</p>
                        <p>And thus he writes alſo to the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> ii. 4.) who knew very well how faithfully they had diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their truſt, and that they did <hi>not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themſelves to any man's humour;</hi>
                           <pb n="564" facs="tcp:204181:652"/>but plainly delivered the meſſage which God had committed to them. No body could ſay that they had <hi>uſed any flattering ſpeeches,</hi> to ſooth them up in a vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of themſelves, (ver. 5.) nor <hi>uſed any colours to hide a covetous deſign:</hi> no, as to their words and addreſſes, the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> could teſtify the contrary; and as to their mind and heart, which God onely could know, they call him to witneſs, it never entred into their thoughts. Nor did they ſeek <hi>glory and fame</hi> either from them or any body elſe, but deſpiſed it as much as riches: unleſs it were the honour of obliging them, by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the bleſſings of the Goſpell to them, and receiving no reward from them: ver. 6. They might indeed have put them to charge, and lived upon their coſt, as other Apoſtles of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, and that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly too: But He and his companions were among them with more <hi>gentleneſs;</hi> (ver. 7.) they parted, that is, from their own undoubted right, to ſpare the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians:</hi> and as a good nurſe cheriſhes her children; ſo they defrauded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and took the meat, as we ſpeak, out of their own mouths, for the good of others whom they deſired to breed up in Chriſtian piety. This ſhews the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:204181:652"/>innocency and goodneſs of theſe men, who got nothing by the Goſpell, (no not what they might have lawfully and juſtly taken,) but onely ſtudied how to win Souls to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> In ſhort, he calls <hi>them</hi> and <hi>God</hi> alſo to witneſs, how <hi>holily,</hi> how <hi>juſtly,</hi> how <hi>unblamably</hi> they behaved themſelves among thoſe that believed: ver. 10. The firſt of which words refers to God; the ſecond to thoſe actions which belong to humane ſociety; and the third to thoſe which every man is bound unto ſeverally by himſelf: in none of which could <hi>He, Silvanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> be charged with any miſdemeanour. On which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he once more inſiſts 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 10, 11. being ſo confident of his unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable vertue, that he deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of all that knew him, but <hi>to be followers</hi> of him, and <hi>to walk ſo as they had him for an example.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 16. iii. <hi>Phil.</hi> 17.</p>
                        <p>All which I have the more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noted, becauſe it is from theſe men that we receive <hi>the teſtimony of Jeſus.</hi> Who, they aſſure us, choſe to die the moſt ſhamefull death, when he could have avoided it; and with the greateſt
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:204181:653"/>confidence, when he was expiring, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Spirit into the hands of God. Which is an unqueſtionable argument that he believed, and was aſſured, that he ſhould be with God, when he went from hence, and be able to doe for his followers all that he promiſed. Which they tell us moreover God juſtified, when he raiſed him from the dead, and carried him, in their ſight, up into heaven: and afterward ſent the Holy Ghoſt upon them, to teſtify that he was ſtill alive, and poſſeſſed of an unſeen glory. In which, they alſo tell us, he appeared to ſeverall perſons; as I have already rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. One of which was caught up into heaven, and heard ſuch things there as made him wiſh for nothing more, then to leave this earth, and to be with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> To whom the Angels, they alſo aſſure us, witneſſed upon ſeverall occaſions. For they attended him at his birth, and in his life, and when he died, and after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and when he aſcended into heaven: From whence he ſent them many times, as miniſtring Spirits, to his Apoſtles; of which we have very large teſtimonies in the whole book of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="567" facs="tcp:204181:653"/>From all which we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there can no other reaſon in the world be given, why any man thus informed ſhould not believe the Goſpell, but onely his own deſperate wickedneſs. For the things propounded therein are moſt deſirable above all other. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals ſuch a wonderfull love of God to mankind, that all men would rejoyce to hear the news of it, were they not averſe to thoſe pious and vertuous courſes whereby, they are told, they muſt attain it. Nothing attracts all hearts ſo much as the hope of a bleſſed immortality: which is teſtified to us ſo credibly in the Goſpell, that nothing could make men turn their ears away from it by infidelity, but onely the incurable wickedneſs of their Nature; which will not let them part with thoſe vices, which the Goſpell ſays they muſt quit for ſo great a Good. In one word, there is nothing in this Book but what is ſutable to all mens deſires, ſave onely the holy rule of life: and therefore it can be nothing elſe but their hatred to this, which makes them reject all the reſt. They would follow their nobler appetite after thoſe good things which the Goſpell promiſes, if they had
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:204181:654"/>not perfectly given up themſelves to thoſe baſer appetites, which muſt be denied for their ſake. For <hi>if our Goſpell be hid,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the place before mentioned, <hi>it is hid to them that are loſt: In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 3, 4. That which the Goſpell reports is as clear as the noon-day. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more viſible then the <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>ſplendour</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, which if any man do not ſee, after ſuch evident demonſtrations of theſe things, it is his wickedneſs hinders him. And ſuch men, after they have long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the light, fall under the power of the Devil ſo inevitably, that he blinds their eyes. Mark, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that the Scripture calls ſeverall things by the name of a <hi>God,</hi> not from their own worth and excellence, but

Thus <hi>Mammon</hi> is the God of ſome, and <hi>the belly</hi> the God of others, and <hi>the Devill</hi> the God of all ſuch perſons; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are baſely inſlaved to the love of mony, and of their fleſhly appetite, and He rules and governs them as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely as if he were their God. Yet he hath no power quite to blind their eyes, as he farther obſerves, before they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe that which is ſo credibly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſuch Divine arguments: for, as the very words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> are, <hi>he blinds the minds of them that believe not.</hi>

                              </note> David and Moſes; but they appeared as ſervants, as thoſe that had a Maſter. It is the peculiar glory of our Saviour, that he appeared as a Lord, as having power over all: and though in a poor and vile faſhion, yet even in that the Creation knew its Lord and Maſter. A Star from heaven called the Wiſe men to worſhip him. A great company of Angels often attended him, and ſang his praiſes. To whom others ſucceeded, who publiſhed his glory, and delivered this ſecret Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to another: the Angels to the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds; and the Shepherds to thoſe in the city; and Gabriel to Mary and Elizabeth; and Anna and Symeon to thoſe in the Temple. Nor were men and women onely tranſported with the pleaſure; but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant that had not ſeen the light leapt in its mother's womb: and all were ſtrangely lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up in hopes of what was a-coming.
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:204181:655"/>Theſe things all fell out ſtraightway after his birth. But when he appeared in the World, there were more Miracles, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the former, appeared again. For not ſo little as a Star and the Heavens, not Angels or Archangels, not Gabriel or Michael, but the Father himſelf proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him from heaven; and with the Father, the Comforter came down with a voice, and remained on him. And therefore well might the Apoſtle ſay,</hi> We have ſeen his glory, the glory as of the onely-begotten of the Father. <hi>And not by theſe things alone, but by thoſe which followed after. For now not merely Shepherds, and an aged Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, and reverend men, publiſhed the glad tidings of the Goſpell; but the voice it ſelf of the things he did, louder then the ſound of any trumpet; which was heard preſently every-where. For the fame of him, ſaith the Evangeliſt, went into all Syria; and revealed him to all, and cried every-where that the King of heaven was come to men. For Daemons every-where fled and got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and the Devill departed; and Death began to give place, and not long after quite vaniſhed; and all manner of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were looſed; and the tombs diſmiſſed the dead; the Daemons left thoſe that were mad, and Diſeaſes thoſe that were ſick.
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:204181:656"/>Wonderfull and ſtrange things were to be ſeen, which the Prophets deſired to ſee, and did not. For one might have ſeen eyes new made, paralytick lims ſtrengthened, motion given to withered hands and lame feet, ears that were ſtopt up opened, and the tongues of the dumb looſed. In one word, like an excellent workman that comes into an houſe which is decayed and rotten by time, he repaired, or re-built rather, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For who can tell how he made the Souls of men new, which is a greater wonder then all the reſt? For the wills of men oppoſe their cure, which the body doth not. They will not yield, we ſee, no, not to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And yet theſe were reformed by him; and all kind of wickedneſs expelled. Nor were they onely freed from Sin; but, like the bodies to which he gave the beſt habit after he had cured their diſeaſes, they were advanced to the higheſt degree of vertue. A Publican became an Apoſtle. A perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutour, a blaſphemer, a reproacher of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, turned the Preacher of the Word. A thief was made a Citizen of Paradiſe: and a ſtrumpet became illuſtrious by a great faith. And abundance of others, worſe then theſe, were liſted in the number of the
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:204181:656"/>Diſciples, till whole cities and countries were ſtrangely reformed by the Goſpell. Who is able to declare the wiſedom of his Precepts, the vertue of his heavenly Laws, the excellent order of his Angelicall Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation? For he hath taught us ſuch a life, he hath given us ſuch laws, and inſtituted ſuch a polity; that they who uſe them, though before the worſt of men, ſtraightway become Angels, and like to God, according to our power. The Evangeliſt therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting all theſe things, the Miracles he wrought upon mens bodies, upon their Souls, and upon the elements; the Precepts, the ſecret Gifts, the Laws, the Polity, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of perſwaſion, the future Promiſes, his Sufferings; he pronounced this wonderfull lofty voice,</hi> We beheld his glory, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as of the onely-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For they did not admire him onely for his Miracles, but for his Sufferings. As for example, becauſe he was nailed to a Croſs and ſcourged; becauſe he was beaten; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſpit upon; becauſe thoſe buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, to whom he had been a benefactour: upon the account even of theſe, which ſeem moſt ſhamefull, that voice is worthy to be repeated again; becauſe he himſelf hath
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:204181:657"/>called this a Glory. For then Death was deſtroyed, the Curſe was diſſolved, Daemons were put to ſhame, and he triumphed over them openly, and the hand-writing of ſins, or obligation to puniſhment, was nailed to the Croſs and cancelled. And beſides theſe wonders, which were inviſible, there were others apparent unto all; which ſhewed he was the onely-begotten Son of God, and the Lord of all the Creation. For while his bleſſed body yet hung upon the Croſs, the Sun withdrew its beams, the earth was aſtoniſhed and wrapt in darkneſs, the ground ſhook, the tombs were broke open, a great many dead people walkt out of their graves, and went into the City, the ſtone upon his grave was rolled away, and he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe. He that was crucified, he that was faſtned with nails to the croſs, he that was dead aroſe; and filling his Apoſtles with great power, ſent them to all the World, as the common phyſicians of humane Nature, the rectifiers of mens lives, the ſowers of the knowledge of heavenly Doctrine, the looſers of the Devill's tyranny, the teachers of the great and hidden Goods, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the glad tidings of the immortality of the Soul, the Eternall life of the body, and the rewards which (as they paſs all underſtanding, ſo) never have any end.
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:204181:657"/>Theſe and many more ſuch like this bleſſed man beholding, (which he knew, but was not able to write, becauſe the world could not have contained the Books,) he cried out,</hi> We beheld his glory, the glory as of the onely-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. <hi>Who is now as able, I may adde, to give us new bodies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably-improved Souls, and then to perpetuate the happineſs of both in heaven; as he was to cure diſeaſes, and raiſe dead bodies, and purify mens minds, when he was here on earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>

                     <p>THE grounds of Chriſtian belief, you ſee, are not ſo ſlender, but I may take the confidence to ſay, that he who will be at the pains to conſider ſuch things as theſe, cannot any longer think it a piece of wit to be an infidel. It is rank folly, as well as baſeneſs; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no reaſon in the earth to except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Witneſſes, and to deny the Faith of <hi>Chriſt</hi> an entrance into our minds and hearts. For what we know, as I have ſhewn in the former Book, by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible report, is as certain as what we ſee and hear with our eyes and ears. And what can be better atteſted then the holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell? Which is juſtly called <hi>the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 1. and <hi>the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Chriſt,</hi> i. 6. Becauſe God teſtified theſe things to us as his will, by his Son <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> teſtified them to us by the holy Ghoſt. For ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the place laſt named, (ver. 5, 6.) the
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:204181:659"/>
                        <hi>Corinthians</hi> were <hi>inriched</hi> by our Lord <hi>with every gift; even as the teſtimony of Chriſt was confirmed,</hi> or eſtabliſhed to be a truth, <hi>among them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After which mighty evidence, whereby we are aſſured God intends to beſtow ſo great a bleſſing on us as immortall Life, it is of no weight whatſoever can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt this Doctrine; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, againſt that part of it which concerns the Reſurrection of the body, at the laſt day. For that Great Lord who ſaid it, we are certain, can perform it. He knew his own power; and would not have ſaid, <hi>I will raiſe you up at the laſt day,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had been able to make his word good. He hath alſo already fulfilled his word in other things which he foretold, though no body would believe him till they ſaw it: which is a good ground, as St. <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> obſerves

<pb n="579" facs="tcp:204181:659"/>to take but one ſingle grain out of an heap of corn, and to tell him he ſhould ſee in that the virtue of all the reſt? For he that ſees one grain of wheat or barly caſt into the ground, coming up after ſome time a full ear, will never doubt of the fruitfulneſs of all the reſt of the ſame kind. Even juſt ſo, ſaith he, it ſeems to me a ſufficient teſtimony of the Reſurrection, that the truth of other things, which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, cannot be denied. In them we have an experiment, whereby we may judg of every thing elſe that he hath ſaid.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to demand that every thing ſhould be made out by reaſon, before we receive it, is to make us <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> not <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> whoſe name is <hi>Believers.</hi> And beſides, the beſt Philoſophers cannot tell us how the Corn, I now mentioned, grows up from a little Seed caſt into the ground, or a Man from ſo ſmall a beginning in his mother's womb; or any thing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the manner how all naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions are performed. And therefore what folly is it to reſolve not to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, unleſs we ſhew how a dead body can be raiſed? It is ſufficient to know that <hi>idoneus eſt reficere qui fecit,</hi> as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>

It being more, as he goes on, to make, then to re-make; to give a beginning to a thing, then to reſtore it after it is diſſolved. And we have this alſo to ſatisfy us; that multitudes ſaw our Saviour raiſe men from the dead, and by other miraculous works demonſtrate, that he wants not power to doe any thing he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. His word may well be taken for any thing to come, who hath already done ſuch wonders as are credibly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, by thoſe that were ſpectatours of them, in the Goſpell.</p>

<pb n="581" facs="tcp:204181:660"/>to his power of raiſing the dead: For that which men thought impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, he ſhew'd hereby was not incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. Who could have thought, that one ſick of a burning fever ſhould be made ſo well by ſpeaking a word, as to riſe preſently, and miniſter to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? yet <hi>Simon</hi>'s wife's mother was an inſtance of this Miraculous power in our Saviour. Who added ſomething to this Miracle, when he reſtored the Nobleman's ſon to health, though he was at the point of death, as his Father thought: (iv. <hi>Joh.</hi> 47.) and this without touching, or coming near him. For he did not ſtir from the place where he was at <hi>Cana,</hi> and yet ſent life to him as far as <hi>Capernaum,</hi> by the ſole power of his command. After which he proceeded to an higher Miracle; for he reſtored another Ruler's daughter to life, who died before he came to her reſcue. And again he exceeded this Miracle, by raiſing up the woman's ſon of <hi>Naim,</hi> when he was carrying out to be buried. And at laſt (as hath been before obſerved) he raiſed his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working power ſo high, that he called <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of his grave, when he had been dead four days.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="582" facs="tcp:204181:661"/>Thus he raiſes our minds by little and little to the higheſt pitch of Faith; to believe, that is, the Reſurrection of the dead. He teaches us to expect that in generall, the experiment of which he hath ſhewn in particulars, For, as the Apoſtle faith, (1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> iv. 16.) <hi>the Lord ſhall deſcend with a ſhout,</hi> &amp;c. at the reſtauration of all things, to raiſe the dead to a ſtate of incorruption: even ſo now, he that lay in his grave was awakened <hi>by the voice</hi> of our Saviour's command, and ſhaking off his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, came whole and ſound out of his tomb; the bands wherewith his hands and feet were tied nothing hindring. Is this nothing to confirm our belief of the Reſurrection? when we have not onely our Lord's <hi>word</hi> for it, but, by thoſe whom he reſtored to life, we have in <hi>deed</hi> a demonſtration of what he hath promiſed? What pretence is there now for unbelief? Why do we not ſlight all thoſe who by Philoſophy and vain deceit ſet themſelves againſt a ſimple faith, and ſtick to this naked confeſſion, that there will be a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body to Eternall Life?</p>

Which is a very great motive to Faith; whereby we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of a great many things, and thoſe the moſt excellent, of which other mens minds are perfectly ignorant. It gives a new light to the Soul, whereby to ſee things inviſible. There is no leſs then a whole world of things that Believers are acquainted withall, which are hid from their eyes who remain in darkneſs, by continuing in unbelief.

Sure, men never got their eſtates with ſo little care as they hope to get Heaven. Ask a man why he follows his buſineſs ſo cloſe; and he will tell you, that an eſtate is not got by wiſhing: that a family cannot be provided for by lying in bed, or ſitting by the fire-ſide: that there are opportunities, which muſt be narrowly watcht; and cheats, which are not eaſily diſcovered. And yet, to ſee the imprudence and inconſiderateneſs of Mankind! The ſame perſon thinks to go to Heaven, and poſſeſs all the treaſures there, by his Prayers alone; though cold too, and but little obſerved: or by a lame Repentance, which wants its effects: nay, by a death-bed groan, a few forced tears, and promiſes never performed: by ſome ſhort ſnatches of Religion, a careleſs behaviour, and an unwatchfull life. He minds no occaſion of doing or receiving good; is indifferent whether he lay hold of opportunities and good ſeaſons; ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thinks of the place whither he would
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:204181:667"/>go; denies himſelf nothing to which he hath a mind; bridles no appetite; curbs no paſſion; nay, will be drunk for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and ſwear, rather then be thought ſuch a coward as to ſtand in awe of God, or to want the breeding of a Gentleman; and, in brief, doth not half ſo much upon the account of <hi>Eternall Life,</hi> as many a man does for a ſingle-peny.</p>

The Souldier gets not the victory by mere railing at his enemy; but, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 3, &amp;c. <hi>endures hardneſs,</hi> and <hi>entangles not himſelf with the affairs of this life.</hi> And it is the <hi>labouring husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> as it there follows, <hi>who partakes of the fruits.

It is a great ſhame to ſay it, but ſuch are the hopes of fooliſh
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:204181:667"/>men: who are perfectly like the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> of whom God ſays, x. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. <hi>Ephraim is an heifer that is taught,</hi> to plow; <hi>but loveth</hi> onely <hi>to tread out the corn.</hi> That is, as <hi>D.

                        <p>Let ſuch remember, for a ſtory ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſticks longer in their minds then the greateſt reaſon, what a Wiſe man among the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid to a Friend of his, whom he met exceeding ſad and dejected about ſome affairs which went croſs to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. <q>What's the matter, ſaid he, that thou goeſt ſo heavily? doth any thing of this world trouble thee? Yes, ſaid the other. And what haſt thou got, ſaid the Wiſe man again, by all thy care, ſolicitude and vexation? Alas! replied his Friend, thou ſeeſt by my troubled countenance how little I have got. Then, ſaid the Wiſe man, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; if of this World, which thou haſt followed with ſuch diligence, thou haſt got ſo little; what art thou like to get of the other World, which thou min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not at all?</q> A very good Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:204181:668"/>for thoſe who, after all their labour and thoughtfulneſs, are like to leave no great matters to their poſterity; and for thoſe whoſe greateſt cunning and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is not able to bring about their ends. And it may lead us to another profitable Meditation, how unequall we are in our dealing, while we lay out ſo many thoughts, and ſo much labour, upon things we are not ſure to obtain; and ſo few and ſo little upon thoſe which, as ſure as God is true, ſhall be the portion of them that diligently ſeek them. The Souldier is not ſure to win the victory, after all the hardſhip he has endured. And the froſt may nip, and the bitter winds blaſt, the laborious Husbandman's faireſt hopes. There is no deſign, ſave onely that we have for Heaven, but, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our beſt diligence, may miſcarry. What madneſs then is it, thus to miſplace our endeavours, by imploying them ſo ſeriouſly about thoſe things which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently avoid us and fly from us; in the mean time neglecting thoſe of infinite more value, which earneſtly court us, and are deſirous to beſtow themſelves upon us?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="597" facs="tcp:204181:668"/>But there is no need of ſo many words to awaken our thoughts, to judge aright in theſe matters. And yet this is all we have to doe for our Salvation, (when we believe the Goſpell,) to think often what we believe, and expect to receive from the bounty of Heaven.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Which if every one did, it might ſpare me the labour of asking again, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we think in our conſcience it is any great matter God demands of us, when he bids us, if we will obtain eternall life, obey his will revealed to us by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Review the Chriſtian Doctrine, a brief account of which I gave in the former Book; <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>v.</label> and when you have ſeen all that you are to doe, or to deny and ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake, conſider to what it will amount. If we take it compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and caſt it into the ſcales againſt immortall Life and the weight of Glory, it will preſently ſeem ſo little, light and inconſiderable, that we ſhall not think it worth the ſpeaking of. But let us wave that advantage, and onely conſider every thing in it ſelf abſolutely.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="598" facs="tcp:204181:669"/>1. What great matter is it that we find God expects we ſhould doe for him? Had he bid us govern the World, and rule the Nations of the earth; he had ſet us a difficult task indeed: But when he requires us onely to govern our ſelves, to ſet in order our affections, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due our unruly paſſions, which give us no ſmall trouble, and expoſe us to great danger; what a reaſonable demand is this? and upon what eaſie terms does he offer Eternall life? We might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, if he had but required every one of us to be rich, and to get great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; much more if he had expected we ſhould be Philoſophers, and be able to give an account of the ſecrets of Nature, and reſolve all the queſtions we meet withall about the air and the water and the reſt of the Elements: But when he onely bids us be content with our portion, and ſtay for what his wiſedom will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe to us, and make a ſober uſe of it; and be ſo wiſe as to acknowledge him in all things, and to diſcern good from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and live vertuouſly in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him and of our ſelves, and give a reaſonable account of all our actions; one may well wonder what men would
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:204181:669"/>have God to ſay, if they call this a very heavy burthen. But what if he ſhould command us, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to offer up an onely Son; or to feed all our life up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bread and water; or, with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorets, dig our graves in the wilderneſs, and have no other tools but our nails to doe it? ſhould we not think it very hard; though we cannot ſay, as we may of the former, that it is impoſſible? And yet, comparatively ſpeaking, Heaven would be a great bargain after all this. What a purchace then is it, when he calls for no Sacrifice but that of our <hi>own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> which we are to preſent him holy, chaſt and pure, with true devotion and humility of ſpirit; together with the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of praiſe</hi> continually; <hi>giving thanks unto him</hi> for all his benefits; and not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting to doe good, and to communicate;</hi> which are all <hi>reaſonable ſervices,</hi> and <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices with which God is well pleaſed?</hi> xii. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. xiii. <hi>Heb.</hi> 15, 16. At what lower rate can Eternall life be ſet then this, that we will not be unreaſonable? When will we be pleaſed, if it will not ſatisfie us to know that God will give us Eternall life, provided we will live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, and be gratefull to him who is the giver of all good things, and doe to
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:204181:670"/>others as we would that they ſhould doe to us? Is God beholden to us, when we accept of theſe terms of Salvation? They that imagine this too great a mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that they doe ſome mighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when they take this courſe to go to heaven, muſt mortifie that conceit, or it is not likely they will come thither.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But let us proceed, to conſider what it is we muſt deny and ſuffer to attain this Felicity; and ſee to what the reckoning will come. If we put our ſins into the number of thoſe things we muſt forſake; it is apparent already, it would be a trouble to keep them. We are required indeed to <hi>crucifie the fleſh;</hi> which ſeems an hard ſaying. But when we have enquired the meaning of it, there is no ſeverity to be found in it. For it doth not oblige us to deſtroy, or ſo much as to impair, any faculty belonging to us: neither to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Underſtanding, nor dull the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, nor overload the Memory; no nor conſume our ſpirits, nor deform our bodies, nor prejudice our healths, nor ſpoil our beauty, or any thing elſe that God hath made. There is no true pleaſure of which he deprives us; unleſs it be ſometimes for a better and more
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:204181:670"/>excellent end. He onely abridges our unjuſt liberty, and limits the hurtfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of our deſires and paſſions; which we are not to gratifie againſt our reaſon, to the injury of our ſelves or our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and to the indangering the loſs of ſome better good. In brief, He allows us to pleaſe our ſelves, ſo that every part of us be pleaſed; our Judgment and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as well as the lower Appetites. And what now doth all this amount unto, but the doing our ſelves a reall and intire kindneſs?</p>
                        <p>But in ſome ſtate of things God will have us forſake all our worldly goods and poſſeſſions, for the kingdom of heaven's ſake; as he required the Apoſtles and the firſt Diſciples to Chriſtianity. True. But do we not ſet too high a price upon theſe things, if we value our obedience at a great rate, upon this account? I will let alone the compariſon we ought to make between our loſs and our gain. Weigh things impartially by themſelves, and conſider what it is we part withall; ſhould we ſuffer all our worldly goods to be taken from us, rather then part with our Religion. Do we loſe any more then a Philoſopher hath left of his
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:204181:671"/>own accord, for the convenience of his ſtudy; and that he might not be incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in his contemplations? And while we had them, were all thoſe things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us? Doth Nature require ſo much? Did not a great many of them lie by us unuſed? What a ſmall matter now does the account come to, when we have made this abatement? And how little reaſon is there, that the parting with theſe things ſhould make ſuch a noiſe, as if we had made ſome exceeding rich preſent to God's almighty love, from whom we received them?</p>
                        <p>But let us look upon them again, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the loſs of life; and conſider, Are they things which we could have kept very long? Do we any more then part with them a little before the time? And what difference is there between their leaving us, and our leaving them; but the advantage we have, by living a while after them, to give a proof of a little very ſhort patience, and of intire truſt in God, and abſolute reſignation to his will? Let the things we leave for God's ſake be rated as high as we pleaſe, all that can be made of them comes at laſt to this; that, in obedience to God,
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:204181:671"/>we let them go a little before we could not enjoy them. And ſuppoſe we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to die; it is but to go another way out of the world, then we muſt ſhortly, perhaps preſently, have done. There is no difference at all, but onely as much as there is between a ſword, and an acute diſeaſe; between the flames of fire, and thoſe of a burning fever.</p>
                        <p>But we may endure many torments, perhaps, in the world before we die; which are worſe then death it ſelf. It may be ſo; and there is a poſſibility, it may not be ſo. Now ſuppoſing we do not ſuffer any torments, what a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it that God asks, that we may go to Heaven? where we ſhall have an Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo great, that we may well, <hi>if need be,</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks,) conſent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſomething that looks more like ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniall then any thing I have mentioned, to obtain it. And yet when that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity comes, this will ariſe to no great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe. It is no more then we may na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſuffer by the ſtone, or the gout, or by ſome ſuch diſeaſe which may ſeize upon us; and not carry us to heaven neither. And it is likewiſe conſiderable, that wicked men many times take more
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:204181:672"/>pains, and endure a great deal more then this comes to, to go to hell. Do we not ſee what attendance their luſts require from them? and that they make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for their ſatisfaction with much ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude and trouble? Nay, do not their expences frequently run very high, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie ſome worldly or fleſhly deſire? One man breaks his ſleep; another pines his body; a third conſumes his eſtate; a fourth nouriſhes loathſome and foul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; a fifth breeds cruell and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pains, which ſet him upon the rack; a ſixth ventures his life, and runs the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the gallows, or of a ſeverer death. And all ſinners contrive and plot and trouble their brains to find opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and are often vexed with diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, and as often put to ſhame, and always troubled with their deſires, till they meet with ſome ſatisfaction; and being never ſatisfied, are always troubled with their reſtleſs deſires.</p>
                        <p>Let all theſe things be conſidered ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly; and then tell me, whether God demands great things of us, to obtain E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Life: and doth not rather won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully oblige us, in accepting ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly our poor ſervices; nay, carries us
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:204181:672"/>from the happineſs of doing his will here, to the happineſs of having it rewarded with a moſt glorious recompence in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world.</p>

For <hi>we hope in the living God, who is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of all men, eſpecially of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi> But it cannot be obtained by any other means. For they that ſtick to this World as weeds do to the rocks in the ſea, ſlight immortality; and judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unworthy of the other World, which at ſo low a rate offered it ſelf to their Faith and Charity.</p>

                           <pb n="606" facs="tcp:204181:673"/>But we have juſt reaſon to proceed a great deal farther then all this; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a man could alway live here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt trouble, and in the fulleſt contentment that either his Soul or body can now enjoy, I ask again, <hi>whether a man that believes the Goſpell would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have his Eternall life in this World:</hi> and not rather chuſe to go thither, where both Soul and body ſhall be ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully improved, as to be capable of more ſolid, pure and durable pleaſures, then this Earth can ever afford. He that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders how weak humane Nature is in this ſtate, and how unable to entertain it ſelf long with any of thoſe things which pleaſe our ſenſes, will not take much time to reſolve this queſtion. Should we be furniſhed with the beſt delights that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can crave, in the moſt perfect health and vigorous ſtrength; ſtill we ſhould find either fulneſs and ſatiety, or laſſitude and wearineſs follow the enjoyment. This is a great part of man's vanity in his beſt Eſtate; that all his fruitions either ſuppoſe, or make, a conſumption of his ſpirits.</p>

Who would not then, that hath any hopes in another world, freely conſent to a diſſolution, in order to a better conjunction of Soul and body, in a ſtate of greater ſtrength and ſpritelineſs to enjoy a fuller good; with greater conſtancy, without any wearineſs or dejection of appetite, with perfect ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and an eternall pleaſure in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the ſame again?</p>
                        <p>And if we agree to this, judge then what reaſon there is to be exceeding ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to attain that heavenly Bliſs, which ſo inconceivably tranſcends all that we can fanſy to our ſelves, but are never like to enjoy, in this world. And judge again, how unworthy then this ſhort, this troubleſome life, which is but like a dream, full of diſtracted thoughts

Are they afraid of believing it too ſtrongly, for fear it ſhould ſpoil all their earthly delights, and make them loſe the reliſh they have of bodily pleaſures; or hinder their buſineſs, and make them have no liſt to follow it? There is no danger of this: for a lively belief of the Life to come heightens all our other joys, by making them innocent; and furthers our affairs, by making us diligent, but

                           <pb n="610" facs="tcp:204181:675"/>It is a ſaying among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that when God firſt created Man, his ſtature was ſo tall, that he reached from heaven to earth, and could graſp all this world in his arms, as a very little thing. But <hi>poſt peccatum Deus eum minuit ad cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum cubitos;</hi> after he ſinned, God took him down to the height of an hundred cubits.

The Morall of it is very true. And if the Chriſtian Faith, like the breath of life wherewith God inſpired Man at the firſt, did throughly poſſeſs and renew our Souls; we ſhould grow up again to ſuch an excellent pitch, as to be above all the Earth, and tread it under our feet.

                           <pb n="620" facs="tcp:204181:680"/>Ah wretched fools that we are, to let our Souls be cheated ſo eaſily of ſuch an happineſs! or rather thus to impoſe upon our ſelves with ſuch weak and childiſh imaginations! Is any thing here grown ſo big, that we cannot ſee the diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between it and Heaven? or is this World of ſuch grand concern to us, that we cannot be at leiſure to hear what our Saviour offers us? Have we no greater regard to theſe <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> then to ſuffer them to be baffled by every fleſhly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, though never ſo ſilly and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable? Let us bethink our ſelves a little better. Let us doe them ſo much right, as to examine them impartially; and then if they deſerve not belief, let the Devill and the World take all. But if they declare beyond all exception, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Lord, and hath Eternall life, and will beſtow it on thoſe that obey him, let us not be ſo bold as to ſlight him any longer; but go and humbly tender our hearts to him, and give him thanks that he will accept them. Is his yoke, think you, uneaſy, and his burthen too great a load? What was the load then which he carried, when all our ſins were laid upon him? what a yoke was the
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:204181:680"/>Croſs it ſelf, and all the indignities that he ſuffered? And yet <hi>for the joy that was ſet before him</hi> (and which he hath now ſet before us) he endured all with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable patience. And indeed what can be too hard for him, who knows he labours for an infinite reward? Do we not all part with things very deſirable, for a ſmall gain we are to get by the exchange? And how earneſt, how fierce are we to drive on ſuch a bargain? How conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly can the tradeſman loſe his dinner on the market-day, rather then loſe a cuſtomer, by whom he hopes to gain a ſhilling? All the traffick in the world is carried on by giving one thing for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and many times upon a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And therefore what makes us ſo unwilling to part with any thing in the world that God calls for, when he offers to give us goods of ineſtimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue in the room of it?</p>
                        <p>It is not a ſmall portion that he aſſures us in his love, but he ſays we ſhall <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit all things,</hi> and that for ever. When we have ſerved him threeſcore years and ten, (and who is there, alas! that ſerves him ſo much?) he doth not promiſe to ſettle on us an eſtate of ſo little as four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:204181:681"/>ſcore or an hundred years, of incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable happineſs in the next World; (though we count it no mean bargain here, to part with a Leaſe of 70 years for one of 80 that is of equall value;) but more then ſo many Ages, more then mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of lives, even an Eternall life with himſelf in the heavens. Is there not a vaſt difference? Is not the diſparity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable between what we lay out, and what we receive; and between the bargains we are ſo greedy of here, and this happy exchange which God offers us? Why then is it neglected, as if it were too dear at the rates on which it is propoſed? Are we not willing to give ſo much for it? Or is not the ſecurity good which God gives us for thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly poſſeſſions? Look over the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences again which we have examined, and you will be aſhamed to call them in queſtion. And if you be ſatisfied, it will be a greater ſhame not to purſue this gainfull purchace, with the ſame eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, care and diligence, that we do our ſeverall imployments in this world. We ought to account that day beſt ſpent, not wherein we have got the moſt money, but wherein we have made ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable improvement in true wiſedom,
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:204181:681"/>and done ſome ſingular ſervice to our Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who is our hope.

<pb n="631" facs="tcp:204181:685"/>more youthfull) <hi>day by day.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 14, 16. And (2.) this faith alſo preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them from ſwounding <hi>fear,</hi> either of diſgrace, or pain, or death; being <hi>in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing terrified by their adverſaries:</hi> (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle i. <hi>Phil.</hi> 28.) who, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them undaunted under all their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, had reaſon to look upon this as <hi>an evident token of their perdition,</hi> and of the <hi>Salvation</hi> God would give to theſe his valiant Champions. And (3.) from ſorrowing alſo, and lamenting the loſs of any thing; becauſe this Good, they found, was ſtill ſecure. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 10. Which made them, as he there ſaith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to be always full of joy, though in the eye of the world they lookt very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully. And ſo (<hi>laſtly</hi>) they kept their ſtedfaſtneſs, and turned not away from the holy commandment delivered unto them. Whereby they marvellouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promoted Chriſtianity: <hi>And the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternall glory by Chriſt Jeſus, after that they had ſuffered a while, made them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſtabliſhed, ſtrengthened, ſettled them.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> v. 10.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. But the hope of Eternall life did not merely <hi>ſupport</hi> and uphold their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:204181:686"/>it wonderfully <hi>refreſhed and comforted</hi> them in all their afflictions: ſo that they durſt confidently promiſe to all other ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Chriſtians the ſame heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts from God. <hi>Who comforteth us</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we our ſelves are comforted of God. And our hope of you is ſtedfaſt, knowing that as you are partakers of the ſufferings, ſo ſhall ye be alſo of the conſolation.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 4, 7. Their comfort and rejoycing was, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their conſcience, that every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where they acted ſincerely; (ver. 12.) and that they ſerved a good Maſter, who had promiſed them better fare in the next World, where he reigns in full power and glory. His Kingdom, they knew, was not of this World, even as he was not of the World; and therefore they did not expect he ſhould give them a portion of good things here. No; He told them plainly, <hi>in the World ye ſhall have tribulation;</hi> but adds in the ſame breath, <hi>be of good chear, I have overcome the World.</hi> xvi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 33.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Which victory of his over death and the grave incouraged them to follow
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:204181:686"/>him in all their tribulations, not merely with ſimple <hi>comfort,</hi> but with <hi>joy,</hi> as I have obſerved already; and more then that, made them <hi>exceeding glad,</hi> and even <hi>ſhout for joy.</hi> So our Saviour himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them to doe, when they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled and perſecuted for his Name ſake. v. <hi>Matt.</hi> 12. <hi>Rejoyce, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven.</hi> And ſo they did, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us v. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>We rejoyce in hope of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God; and not onely ſo, but we glory in tribulations alſo.</hi> For they had this <hi>ſtrong conſolation,</hi> as the Divine Writer to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calls it; <hi>Firſt,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, either in this World or the other, could take away that heavenly Good from them. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo teſtifies in that triumph of his, viii. <hi>Rom.</hi> 38, 39. <hi>I am perſwaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> When their goods were taken away, they could make their boaſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſay, Our inheritance is immovable. When they were driven from houſe and home, (as we ſpeak,) they could triumph, and
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:204181:687"/>ſay, <hi>Our houſe is eternall in the heavens,</hi> from which none can exclude us. When they were in pain, they ſtill remembred our Saviour's own words, <hi>Your joy ſhall no man take from you.</hi> In death it ſelf they could glory, and ſay, <hi>Jeſus, our Life,</hi> dies not; and <hi>becauſe he lives, we ſhall live alſo.</hi> And (2.) as they knew they could not loſe their future Happineſs, ſo they knew it to be incomparably greater then all their ſufferings. viii. <hi>Rom.</hi> 18. <hi>For I reckon, that the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and eternall weight of glory.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 17. Where there is a <hi>Third</hi> Reaſon of their exceeding great joy; becauſe theſe afflictions, which they endured for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake, would increaſe their glory hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and make their crown beyond all expreſſion heavier. And more then that, (4.) hereby not onely their preſent afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were alleviated and ſeemed triviall; but they gave them a clearer ſight of that moſt excellent glory beforehand: <hi>while they looked not</hi> (as it there follows ver. 18.) <hi>at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen;</hi> The removall
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:204181:687"/>of theſe things here below from before their eyes, fixed them more ſtedfaſtly on the inviſible World. Now <hi>their joy was full,</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks xvi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 24. now it overflowed; when all things elſe had forſaken them, and nothing elſe but thoſe unſeen enjoyments remained to comfort them. This heavenly glory ſhone brighteſt in the dark and horrible pit: where their afflictions brought them ſweeter contentment, then ever was the fruit of any earthly pleaſure. And ſo we may ſtill hope, that when other things, by any calamity in this world, ſtand afar off, and can doe nothing for us; there will be the more room for the thoughts and ſenſe of this future bliſs, to ſpread it ſelf, and fill the whole capacity of pious hearts. Then they will be moſt at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; then inviſible things will ſeem moſt reall; then they will moſt ſtrongly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the heart: ſo that they will not be the worſe for their afflictions, but the better; and their pains will but bring them the ſooner to heavenly joys.</p>
                        <p>And ſhould not our Faith work thus mightily in our hearts, at leaſt ſupporting us with true ſatisfaction under all our troubles, it would be an exceeding great
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:204181:688"/>ſhame to us: when we conſider with what reſolution, courage and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they, whoſe knowledge of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things was darker then ours, received the moſt dreadfull ſufferings, even death it ſelf, before the coming of our Saviour. The Mother and her ſeven Sons, whoſe ſtory is recorded in the ſecond Book of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> Chap. vii. are a famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this; who in hope of a bleſſed Reſurrection, when the belief of it ſtood on a feebler foundation then ours, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves to the ſharpeſt torments, rather then break the Law of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. <q>Neither the Strapado, nor the Wheel to rack their joynts, nor Hooks of iron to tear their fleſh, nor the fury of wild Beaſts, nor boiling Caldrons, nor the fierceſt Fires, no evill preſent, no evill to come, could move the hearts of theſe young men, who were in their flouriſhing years; or make them yield a jot to the wicked tyrant, who would have had them tranſgreſs the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Moſes.</hi>

But to compriſe all in a little compaſs, this was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what they ſaid. O King <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi> and all you that are here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, be it known unto you that we have one King, even <hi>God Almighty,</hi> from whom we come, and unto whom we muſt return. And we have one Law-giver, <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom we will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver betray nor reproach; though ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Antiochus,</hi> more fierce and ſevere then thou, ſhould threaten us. <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>. Our onely ſecurity is, to keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and not to break the law where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are guarded. Our onely glory is, for ſuch great things to deſpiſe all glory beſide. Our onely riches are, the hopes we have hereafter. Our onely fear, leſt we ſhould fear any thing more then God. With theſe reaſons we now come armed into the field of danger. We are but young, it is true, and this World is ſweet; our native Country, our Friends, our Kindred, our dear Companions, invite us to ſtay with them. But none of them are ſo
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:204181:689"/>ſweet as God, none ſo dear as thoſe very dangers, which we expoſe our ſelves unto for Vertue's ſake. Harbour no ſuch thoughts, we humbly beſeech you; for there is another World alſo which expects us, more lofty and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by far then all that we behold in this. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above is our Country; which no <hi>Antiochus</hi> can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege, no power on earth can touch or indanger. All thoſe that are born of God, are our Kindred: the Prophets and Patriarchs our Friends, from whom we have received a pattern of piety. And our Companions are all thoſe who hazzard themſelves with us this day, and are our contemporaries in conſtant ſuffering. Heaven is more glorious then our Temple it ſelf: the Quire of Angels infinitely beyond our ſolemn Aſſemblies: And there is one great Myſtery, GOD himſelf, whom all our ſacred Myſteries here reſpect. And therefore ceaſe to make us any more offers and promiſes of little things, which are nothing worth. We love not thoſe ſhamefull honours, which we ſhall get by denying God. We were not bred to make ſuch unthrifty bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains; and cannot traffick with thee
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:204181:689"/>on ſuch baſe and ignoble terms. And therefore ceaſe alſo to threaten us; or we can return more dreadfull threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, which will reprove thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For know that we have a fire, into which to throw our Perſecutours. Doſt thou think thou haſt to doe with Gentile people? Thoſe, it is true, thou haſt overcome: they have yielded to thy threatnings and power. And no wonder; for they did not fight for ſuch glorious things as we. They one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended their cities and goods; but we defend the Law of the moſt High. Thou oppoſeſt thy ſelf now againſt the Tables writ with the finger of God; againſt the moſt holy and divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; againſt the Rites of our country, which reaſon and time have made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; againſt ſeven Brethren, who are linkt together by one Soul; whom it is no ſuch mighty buſineſs to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, but to be worſted by them will be moſt ſhamefull. And be aſſured, we will ſet up ſeven Monuments of thy diſgrace: for we are the progeny and diſciples of thoſe who were led by a pillar of fire and a cloud; to whom the Sea parted it ſelf, and the Sun ſtood ſtill, and Bread rained down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:204181:690"/>and who triumphed over mighty kings, by prayer and lifting up their hands to heaven. And to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that comes within the compaſs of thy knowledge, we are bred up under <hi>Eleazar,</hi> whoſe fortitude and courage thou art not ignorant of.

Where it will ſtand to our great confuſion, if we ſhould not learn of thoſe who had ſo great a Faith, under ſo dark a revelation. What would not theſe perſons have done, ſaith the forenamed Father, if they had lived in our times; who were ſo courageous before the ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the glory (I may adde) that followed after?

                        <p>There need no more be ſaid to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage even thoſe Chriſtians who have been moſt delicately bred, or that are of the tenderer Sex, to wade through the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt difficulties.

                              </gap>, but the experiment exceeds all belief. Into this the crooked Serpent cannot wind himſelf, as he did into that of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers; nor ſo much as whiſper any of his deceitfull temptations. There is none among us, but whoſe Mind is impregnable, and cannot be overcome by any artifice; nor can we deſire to be gratified with any greater good. For we are all of us wiſe, with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly wiſedom; and our whole life is a continued magnificent feſtivall, in the enjoyment of infinite and unſpeakable goods. Splendidly cloathed, we ſee God in a ſplendid
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:204181:694"/>manner, (as far as man can ſee him;) and raviſhed with his inexplicable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable beauty, we rejoyce alway, and are never weary. Which abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant pleaſure is the very perfection of love; and the power of enjoying ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying love, begets that ineffable joy and exultation of ſpirit. So that now, while I converſe with thee, a moſt mighty love to thoſe things draws me away, and ſuffers me not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the leaſt part of them. Thou, and my dear Mother, ſhall one day come thither; and then confeſs I have ſaid very little of ſuch great Goods; but accuſe thy ſelf very much for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing me, who happily enjoy them. Therefore, my deareſt Father, let me go away with joy, and do not detain me any longer; leſt thou ſuffer a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loſs, and for that be more bitterly afflicted.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>If thy Daughter, I ſay, could after this or the like ſort ſpeak to thee, wouldſt thou not be aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thy lamentations? and chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with joy to let her go away re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing? Conſider then, if upon a Child's ſaying ſuch things, we ſhould
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:204181:694"/>preſently grow better, and be of good comfort; ſhall we, when our common Creatour and Lord cries, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in me, though he die, yet ſhall he live;</hi> and, <hi>God hath prepared for them that love him ſuch things as eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have they entred into the heart of man;</hi> be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better for ſuch joyfull tidings, but, like infidels, go on ſtill to increaſe our ſad lamentations?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>We cannot anſwer this Queſtion any other way, but by ſilence; or rather, chearfull thankſgivings to God, who hath given us ſuch <hi>everlaſting conſolation, and good hope through his grace,</hi> as may well enable us to ſay in every other troubleſome condition, <hi>Why art thou</hi> thus <hi>caſt down, O my Soul? why art thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted within me? Hope in God,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his holy Name, who, thanks be to his goodneſs, giveth us the victory, through our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let us ſhake hands with grief, ſadneſs and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and leave them to thoſe who have no hope of Eternall Life. Let us make our boaſt in the Lord, and ſay <hi>that He is good, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> Come, my Soul, what is it that afflicts
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:204181:695"/>thee? Will not the thoughts of the joys of heaven give thee eaſe, nay perfectly cure thee? Will not a ſight of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſitting on the throne of his glory, revive thee? It is but a moment or two, and we ſhall be with him where he is. Let us have patience for a few days more of baniſhment from our heavenly country. Hold out, my Soul, for a ſhort pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and we ſhall arrive at our promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inheritance. Shall we bemoan our ſelves thus miſerably, for whom our God hath made ſuch gracious proviſion? Shall we be weary, who want but a few ſteps, and we are at our eternall reſt? Behold, behold thy Saviour: Yonder he is: I ſee him ſhining in his celeſtiall glory. He looks upon me, methinks, and ſaith, Be of good chear, for I am preparing a place for thee.</p>
                        <p>Do we not forget, O my Soul, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſo highly advanced; when we ſuffer our ſelves to be thus caſt down and ſadly dejected? Do we not reproach his memory, and, in effect, ſay too groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He is dead, He is not riſen; who can chuſe but mourn and be ſorrowfull? For ſhame let us ſtay our tears, till the teſtimonies we have heard can be diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:204181:695"/>till it appear that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſtill in his grave, and theſe are Six falſe <hi>Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> which ſtand up for him. But in the mean time let us rejoyce, that they never yet could be confuted; but have born down all the oppoſition of the World and the Devill for more then Sixteen hundred years, to the eternall honour of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>O ſweet Name! why do we diſhonour it with ſour faces, and ſad countenances, and a melancholick life? If he live, ſure he will be as good as his word, that we ſhall live alſo. Let us never forget thoſe words of grace, <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> And let us never remember them, but with new delight. Let it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light us to repeat them a thouſand times in a day. As long as we live, let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our ſelves with this; Our Lord hath ſaid, <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> Doth it not fill a Merchant's heart with joy, to hear that his Ship is arrived at a ſafe port; though many leagues from his own houſe? Doth not the Country-man look brisk when his Seed-time is good; though he muſt wait many weeks before he reap his deſired Harveſt? Let not us then be the onely lumpiſh inſenſible
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:204181:696"/>things, who hear the joyfull news that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is alive, and ſafely arrived at our Father's houſe, where there are many Manſions. Let not us be ſo ſtupid as to be diſcontented, who have his word for it, that we ſhall live with him. But let us rejoyce, and ſay as the Pſalmiſt doth, (we have more reaſon for it,
<note place="margin">Pſal. lvi. 10, 11.</note>) <hi>In God will I praiſe his word: in the Lord will I praiſe his word. In him have I put my truſt: I will not be afraid what man,</hi> or any thing elſe, <hi>can doe unto me. Jeſus</hi> hath ſaid I ſhall live: I will depend on his word; and expect, after all my toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings up and down in this troubleſome World, to land ſhortly in the Paradiſe of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Paradiſe!</hi> O that comfortable word! that ſweeteſt of all words! What ſhould we not have given to hear of any hopes of it, if God had not promiſed it? And ſhall we now make light account of it? God forbid. We will not ſigh at the thoughts of death it ſelf; ſeeing it is but the gate of Paradiſe. We will look upon it with a ſmile, and ſay it is welcome. We will tell it that it is a long-lookt-for friend; and bid it doe its office, and make way for our entrance into the place
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:204181:696"/>that <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath prepared for us. What though we have not much acquaintance with that World? what though it be a place where we never were; and from whence no Friend that is gone thither hath returned, to tell us what it is? <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> knew it very well, (that's enough;) elſe he would not have endured ſo much for it. He is perfectly acquainted with it; for from thence he came, and there he is. And therefore let us not be timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, when we think of removing to a ſtrange country; but confidently rely on his knowledge more then our own. Let us remember the words of theſe <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> which ſay, <hi>He is the Son of God, in whom is Eternall Life.</hi> Let us truſt his judgment, who thought it more deſirable to go away, though upon a Croſs, then to ſtay here in the greateſt pleaſure. And ſince all theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſay, He is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; let us reſolve that we will die looking up to him, and ſaying,</p>
                        <p>Lord, remember it is the will of the <hi>Father,</hi> that we ſhould have Everlaſting Life. <hi>Thou</hi> thy ſelf appearedſt to St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> and madeſt him confident thou wilt receive our Spirit. The <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which is the Spirit of Truth, ſaith thou
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:204181:697"/>art glorified, and wilt glorifie us with thy ſelf. This thou haſt preached to us. This thy <hi>Bloud</hi> hath purchaſed for us. This thou didſt <hi>riſe again</hi> to prepare, againſt our coming to thee. This thy holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſay thou ſenteſt them to publiſh to the World. This thou haſt made us believe, and wait for, and ſuffer for, and long to enjoy. O Deareſt Lord, and moſt mercifull Saviour, who art the <hi>true and faithfull Witneſs,</hi> though we miſerable ſinners deſerve to be denied, yet deny not thy ſelf: let not the price of thy precious Bloud be loſt; let not the Word of the Father, of the Holy Ghoſt, thine own Word, fail. If thou art not alive, I am content to periſh. But if thou art, as thou haſt perſwaded me; then I will not ceaſe to call upon thee: I will die with theſe words in my mouth, and be confident thou wilt hear me, LORD JESUS, RECEIVE MY SPIRIT.</p>
                        <p>Thus the bleſſed Martyr St. <hi>Stephen</hi> expired; looking up ſtedfaſtly unto <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the Authour and Finiſher of our Faith,</hi> who then appeared in glory to him. Whoſe example all the reſt of that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army followed; triumphing over
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:204181:697"/>death, in an aſſured hope of immortall life. Which they had not the leaſt doubt of, it is manifeſt from hence, that (as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> obſerves
